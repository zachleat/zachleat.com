the new 2.0 release,\nwe have 211 dependencies.","duration":3.713,"offset":33.226,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So just reducing our dependency\ncount really has some

this change.","duration":1.74,"offset":106.55,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And most of this is because\nwe rewrote the dev server.","duration":3.19,"offset":108.297,"lang":"en"},{"text":"We moved away from

great.","duration":5.137,"offset":203.076,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And then it speeds up your NPM\ninstall, but you do not get the sort","duration":3.709,"offset":208.213,"lang":"en"},{"text":"of

code right in their project.","duration":1.77,"offset":223.907,"lang":"en"},{"text":"As always, 11ty has no telemetry built in.","duration":2.25,"offset":225.966,"lang":"en"},{"text":"Now, telemetry is a mechanism that\nsome frameworks use to track usage.","duration":4.77,"offset":228.216,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So when you run commands for a framework,\nit may be phoning those commands back

it.","duration":3.845,"offset":238.866,"lang":"en"},{"text":"But 11ty doesn&amp;#39;t have\nany of this built in.","duration":2.31,"offset":243.281,"lang":"en"},{"text":"We don&amp;#39;t require you to opt out of this.","duration":2.1,"offset":245.591,"lang":"en"},{"text":"We have no telemetry or tracking built in.","duration":2.44,"offset":247.691,"lang":"en"},{"text":"One of the great practical features\nthat came from this version two","duration":3.25,"offset":250.131,"lang":"en"},{"text":"release is that we have much better\nincremental build support finally.","duration":4.44,"offset":253.381,"lang":"en"},{"text":"I think a lot of folks have been\nwaiting on this for a while.","duration":2.22,"offset":257.821,"lang":"en"},{"text":"Now, previously in 11ty in the version\none release and previous versions that had","duration":5.364,"offset":260.581,"lang":"en"},{"text":"that sort of lower fidelity incremental\nbuild support, if you edited a page in","duration":5.01,"offset":265.945,"lang":"en"},{"text":"your input folder, it would actually\nrebuild only that page, which was great.","duration":4.72,"offset":270.955,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So if you were just working on a\nsingle template or a single content","duration":3.75,"offset":275.698,"lang":"en"},{"text":"page, you could use that incremental\nbuild to only rebuild that one page.","duration":4.555,"offset":279.453,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And that worked great and fine.","duration":1.718,"offset":284.034,"lang":"en"},{"text":"But with the version two release our\nincremental builds got a little smarter.","duration":4.053,"offset":285.752,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So if you edit a layout page or layout\nfile, we only rebuild the content pages","duration":7.476,"offset":290.465,"lang":"en"},{"text":"or the routes that use that layout file.","duration":2.67,"offset":297.941,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So it&amp;#39;s a little bit smarter.","duration":1.32,"offset":300.701,"lang":"en"},{"text":"If you edit a component, so we have this\nnew WebC sort of HTML first component","duration":7.17,"offset":302.057,"lang":"en"},{"text":"file format that we&amp;#39;re, that I&amp;#39;m gonna\ntalk about a little bit more later.","duration":3.34,"offset":309.707,"lang":"en"},{"text":"If you edit an individual\ncomponent, we only rebuild the","duration":2.52,"offset":313.076,"lang":"en"},{"text":"pages that use that component.","duration":1.585,"offset":315.601,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So even smarter.","duration":1.17,"offset":317.323,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And if you edit a page that&amp;#39;s in a\ncollection, and that collection is","duration":3.36,"offset":318.659,"lang":"en"},{"text":"then consumed by a another template\nthat uses it via a pagination, or we","duration":5.85,"offset":322.019,"lang":"en"},{"text":"have this new front matter property\ncalled &amp;#39;eleventyImport&amp;#39; to sort of","duration":4.17,"offset":327.869,"lang":"en"},{"text":"declare those dependencies manually.","duration":2.71,"offset":332.039,"lang":"en"},{"text":"We&amp;#39;ll only rebuild the pages\nthat apply in those cases.","duration":3.75,"offset":334.77,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So just as an example on this build\nshowing here, I edit a blog post and","duration":5.329,"offset":339.18,"lang":"en"},{"text":"in the 11ty documentation site, it\nonly rebuilds and writes two files.","duration":5.4,"offset":344.509,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So those two files are the index\npage, cuz we have a highlighted","duration":3.63,"offset":349.909,"lang":"en"},{"text":"blog section on the index page that\nshows some of the latest blog posts.","duration":4.68,"offset":353.539,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And then the blog index page,\nwhich iterates over the blog","duration":3.33,"offset":358.879,"lang":"en"},{"text":"posts to list them all out.","duration":1.165,"offset":362.214,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So just a smarter way of doing\nincremental builds that doesn&amp;#39;t require","duration":4.112,"offset":363.586,"lang":"en"},{"text":"you to rebuild your entire project.","duration":1.53,"offset":367.698,"lang":"en"},{"text":"Just save you a little bit of time.","duration":1.23,"offset":369.528,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And this is what that &amp;#39;eleventyImport&amp;#39;\ndeclaration might look like.","duration":3.29,"offset":372.888,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So inside of any page where you&amp;#39;re\nusing a different collection and","duration":3.9,"offset":376.178,"lang":"en"},{"text":"you want to rebuild that, whenever\na blog post changes, this is what","duration":4.59,"offset":380.078,"lang":"en"},{"text":"it looks like in that project.","duration":1.23,"offset":384.668,"lang":"en"},{"text":"Now perhaps confusingly, this is using a\nthird party front matter formats, which","duration":5.1,"offset":385.985,"lang":"en"},{"text":"is the JavaScript front matter which\nwill be coming in future versions of 11ty","duration":4.147,"offset":391.085,"lang":"en"},{"text":"and we&amp;#39;ll probably bundle it together.","duration":1.43,"offset":395.232,"lang":"en"},{"text":"But yeah, you&amp;#39;ll probably need to use\nYAML or JS or the existing JSON front","duration":5.216,"offset":396.78,"lang":"en"},{"text":"matter formats for that and  more examples\nof that on the documentation site.","duration":3.273,"offset":401.996,"lang":"en"},{"text":"Another command line flag that came in\n11ty version two is --ignore-initial.","duration":3.74,"offset":407.909,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And that works great\nwith incremental builds.","duration":2.22,"offset":411.698,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So when you use those two commands\ntogether, you can see on the top example","duration":4.23,"offset":413.918,"lang":"en"},{"text":"here, we&amp;#39;re just running incremental.","duration":2.52,"offset":418.148,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And what an incremental build upfront\nis it does a full 11ty build just","duration":4.635,"offset":421.118,"lang":"en"},{"text":"to start out, just to get a good\nbaseline start of your project, to","duration":4.77,"offset":425.753,"lang":"en"},{"text":"get it in a good state for incremental\nbuilds that that come later.","duration":3.511,"offset":430.528,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And that&amp;#39;s important because if you\nhave edited files while the 11ty build","duration":4.522,"offset":434.235,"lang":"en"},{"text":"hasn&amp;#39;t run or is not running actively,\nwe won&amp;#39;t know to apply those changes.","duration":5.01,"offset":438.817,"lang":"en"},{"text":"But if you can pretty much guarantee that\nyou haven&amp;#39;t edited any files or  made","duration":4.79,"offset":444.337,"lang":"en"},{"text":"changes to your content in your project,\nyou can run ignore initial and we&amp;#39;ll","duration":4.11,"offset":449.157,"lang":"en"},{"text":"skip that initial build altogether.","duration":1.74,"offset":453.267,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And we&amp;#39;ll only apply incremental\nbuilds moving forward.","duration":2.91,"offset":455.367,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So if you make changes to your\ncontent pages or layouts as I","duration":3.35,"offset":458.847,"lang":"en"},{"text":"just previously explained, we&amp;#39;ll\napply those incremental builds.","duration":3.61,"offset":462.197,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So yeah, it&amp;#39;s just kind of a way\nto give you more control over the","duration":2.785,"offset":465.832,"lang":"en"},{"text":"initial startup process and whether\nor not to run that full build to","duration":3.991,"offset":468.617,"lang":"en"},{"text":"get your project in a good state.","duration":1.46,"offset":472.608,"lang":"en"},{"text":"I think one of the confusing features\nthat we sort of disabled by default,","duration":5.98,"offset":474.198,"lang":"en"},{"text":"right before the official full version\ntwo release of 11ty, we had this feature","duration":5.01,"offset":480.568,"lang":"en"},{"text":"called emulated pass through copy.","duration":1.68,"offset":485.578,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So it was a way to while you&amp;#39;re\nrunning the dev server locally,","duration":3.778,"offset":487.648,"lang":"en"},{"text":"just fake the pass through copy.","duration":2.25,"offset":491.786,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So it doesn&amp;#39;t actually copy any pass\nthrough copy files to your output folder.","duration":3.96,"offset":494.036,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And in the top example here, you can see\nhow it works by default in 11ty today.","duration":6.57,"offset":498.045,"lang":"en"},{"text":"We&amp;#39;ll copy all your pass through copy\nfiles, and you can see that on, in this","duration":3.56,"offset":504.63,"lang":"en"},{"text":"project there&amp;#39;s almost 7,000 pass through\ncopy files on the 11ty documentation.","duration":4.77,"offset":508.19,"lang":"en"},{"text":"But if you use this new emulated pass\nthrough copy feature, we don&amp;#39;t copy","duration":4.47,"offset":512.998,"lang":"en"},{"text":"any of those files to your output\nfolder and we handle those in the","duration":2.7,"offset":517.468,"lang":"en"},{"text":"dev server for you automatically.","duration":1.62,"offset":520.168,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So it really allows you to speed up your\nbuild by not copying those files

you&amp;#39;re doing\na full build in your production server.","duration":3.99,"offset":528.775,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So it&amp;#39;s just another thing that can\nspeed up your local development time.","duration":3.09,"offset":532.831,"lang":"en"},{"text":"As I kind of mentioned before, we have\na new dev server in 11ty version two.","duration":3.58,"offset":536.126,"lang":"en"},{"text":"It&amp;#39;s really quite a bit smaller than\nour previous browser sync dependency.","duration":4.44,"offset":539.73,"lang":"en"},{"text":"It doesn&amp;#39;t have any bundler built into it.","duration":1.906,"offset":544.235,"lang":"en"},{"text":"It&amp;#39;s super fast to startup.","duration":1.29,"offset":546.181,"lang":"en"},{"text":"It has library load\nthat&amp;#39;s web socket based.","duration":2.58,"offset":547.681,"lang":"en"},{"text":"And we actually have a\nDOM-diffing html updating feature.","duration":3.03,"offset":550.292,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So it has all of the live updating\nfeatures that you would expect","duration":3.21,"offset":553.418,"lang":"en"},{"text":"from, from a dev server but\nyeah, in a much smaller package.","duration":3.816,"offset":556.628,"lang":"en"},{"text":"Yeah, and I think it&amp;#39;s great.","duration":0.87,"offset":560.498,"lang":"en"},{"text":"I&amp;#39;m really excited about it and I think\nthat is really one of the best features","duration":3.644,"offset":561.398,"lang":"en"},{"text":"that went into the version two release.","duration":1.35,"offset":565.042,"lang":"en"},{"text":"Another big thing that went

or may","duration":4.05,"offset":596.683,"lang":"en"},{"text":"not have extra indentation on them.","duration":2.05,"offset":600.733,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So we&amp;#39;ve gotten rid of that feature by\ndefault in 11ty version two, and folks","duration":4.917,"offset":602.783,"lang":"en"},{"text":"have been very happy with that change.","duration":1.98,"offset":607.7,"lang":"en"},{"text":"I think

two, and\nmost folks shouldn&amp;#39;t be aware of this","duration":4.513,"offset":617.933,"lang":"en"},{"text":"because the unpredictability is now gone.","duration":2.28,"offset":622.468,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So things should be more\npredictable in markdown files.","duration":2.02,"offset":625.348,"lang":"en"},{"text":"As Lena mentioned, we do

it.","duration":1.985,"offset":1001.572,"lang":"en"},{"text":"So I think another unique thing about\nWebC is that it&amp;#39;s fully async
