So you’ve reviewed my [past speaking experience](/web/speaking/) and decided that I might be a good fit to speak at your event—how exciting!

As a [long time conference organizer](/web/nejsconf/), I know that organizing can be very difficult work. Thank you for what you’re doing. Building a community is the most important and undervalued part of a long term investment in well-rounded citizens pushing a positive influence on the web at large.

As such, I keep a certain set of personal guidelines that I hold myself accountable to when agreeing to speak at a conference.

* Speaker diversity must be a priority. I will likely remove myself from the lineup if I discover that it was not made a priority.
* Travel and lodging must be paid for every speaker that is traveling to the conference. I’ve seen behind the curtain. I know the economics of conferences. This should be the first item in the budget.
* I don’t allow editorial review of my presentations prior to their delivery.

I will provide:

* A professional talk delivered reliably and on time. All my talks will work without an Internet connection. If my laptop fails at the event, I will have backups of my content.
* A speaker that will _be present_ at the event. I limit myself to a few conferences per year and as such like to listen to the other talks at the event and interact with speakers and attendees.

Sound good? Great! [Email me](mailto:zach@zachleat.com) and we can get started!
