I think it’s valuable to collect my thoughts as sort of a personal brain log, so as each work week progresses I’ll collect notes and publish them at the end of the week. This is the first installment of that series.

* New blog post: [The Co-opetition of Team Web](/web/team-web/)

## Web Fonts

* Google Fonts not only added `font-display` support but are encouraging usage by including `display=swap` in the default code you can copy and paste on their site. Updated my blog post at [Google Fonts is Adding `font-display`](/web/google-fonts-display/) to reflect this. (via [Houssein Djirdeh](https://twitter.com/hdjirdeh/status/1130895027712995329))
* New blog post: [`font-display` is Incompatible with Icon Fonts](/web/font-display-icon-fonts/)

## Eleventy

* Added a new GitHub ❤️ Sponsor button to the top of the [Eleventy repo](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/). It simply links to our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/11ty).
* Eleventy’s mascot, Edison the Static-Generating Possum, turns one year old this week! (via [Kenneth Luplau-Brøgger](https://twitter.com/kluplau/status/1131937557774835713))
* Awesome Eleventy launches:
    - [The Chrome Developers site at web.dev](https://web.dev/) 🤯
    - [Surma’s personal blog at dassur.ma](https://dassur.ma/)
    - [Eyestein’s personal site at eystein.no](https://eystein.no/)
    - Have another? [Pass it along!](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=zachleat)

## AMP

> The bar indicating you’re viewing an @AMPhtml page—and the only visible cue you’re not on the original, real page—seems to be getting progressively smaller, and harder to use.—[Ethan Marcotte](https://twitter.com/beep/status/1131181984674455552)

The AMP toolbar is shrinking, further damaging the integrity of the URL.

Terence Eden, member of the AMP Advisory Committee posted [a scathing review of AMP](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/05/a-report-from-the-amp-advisory-committee-meeting/) on his blog. (via [Brian Suda](https://twitter.com/briansuda/status/1131649766830596096))

## Burnout

> “I only really feel burnout from lack of alignment with goals. So if I work on a project of my own, I recharge because my values are honored.”—[Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1131424076726132736)

Wow—I’ve never seen burnout framed like this but it reverberated through my bones.

## <span class="cased">.io</span> Domains

[Tatiana Mac](https://twitter.com/TatianaTMac) [retweeted an article](https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/1131834952172167168) into my timeline about the [problematic use of `.io` domains](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/22/uk-suffers-crushing-defeat-un-vote-chagos-islands).

I made [a public pledge](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1131897497876652032) to migrate [11ty.io](https://www.11ty.io/) to [11ty.dev](https://www.11ty.dev/) after reading this.
