Ever since I attended my first [Barcamp Omaha](http://barcampomaha.org/) unconference last year, I wanted to give a talk. For this year, I had planned on recycling [the talk I gave at Awesome Camp earlier this year](https://speakerdeck.com/zachleat/side-projects) but I was inspired to speak on a different topic.

*Side note: Major props to [Grain & Mortar](http://grainandmortar.com/) for the [Barcamp Omaha site](http://barcampomaha.org/). Ridiculously good. Seems like [@RWD liked it too](https://twitter.com/RWD/status/376086131018067968).*

Running [NebraskaJS](http://nebraskajs.com/) has been an interesting experience for me. NebraskaJS has always made an effort to [encourage new speakers to give lightning talks](http://nebraskajs.com/2013/call-for-new-speakers/) (and in that vein [our next session](http://www.meetup.com/nebraskajs/events/118573952/) will attempt to be only lightning talks from new speakers).

I’ve noticed a common thread among people jumping into the deep end of speaking at our meetup. They’d often start their talks with “I’m not the most qualified person to speak on this topic,” or “I’m sure you guys are all smarter than me.”

In response, I decided to give a talk about Impostor Syndrome. This talk is non-technical and short (only 7:01). Watch it below.
