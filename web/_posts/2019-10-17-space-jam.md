As part of a Barcamp talk, I made some improvements to the original 1996 Space Jam web site (Space JAMstack, anyone??? Oh, just me—okay):

* Responsive! Change that viewport size y’all
* Manifest and Service Worker for PWA and offline goodness!
* Removed tracking and advertisements
* Proper character encoding
* Standards and not quirks rendering mode
* Meta viewport for zooooooom
* Improved semantic markup (some, not all)
* Accessibility improvements
* Use some CSS instead of old-school HTML presentation attributes
* Show an example of pulling the Planet B-Ball text out of the navigation image and into the HTML content.
* Use SVG where we can (for crisp scaling)
* Add `preload` for a few assets to help maintain original page speed
* Lighthouse results: <img src="/web/img/posts/space-jam-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse results of the new Space Jam site: 97 performance, 100 accessibility, 100 best practices, 100 SEO">

## Video

There _is_ video of this but just a fair warning—this may be one of the worst talks I’ve ever given. It took me over a year of it sitting around before I was sufficiently _over it_ to post it up here. In retrospect, I bit off way too much live coding for 30 minutes. I also had a few tech-failures, most notably with the new Touchbar and Voiceover 😱 (I usually use an external keyboard and my muscle memory was off).

Anyway, if you’re sufficiently brave or enjoy cringing you can check out the video on either [Tech Omaha](https://techomaha.com/2018/09/zach-leatherman-space-jam/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30LR5hQT4Qk).
