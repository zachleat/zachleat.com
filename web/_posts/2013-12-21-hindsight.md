Rather than a bunch of individual “In Case You Missed It” tweets, I thought I’d just do one big yearly semi-comprehensive recap of the web community things that I contributed to this year. Enjoy!

## Tool or Die <span class="tag video">Video</span>

If you only watch one web development talk I’ve done this year, make it this one. It’s a soup to nuts talk about a variety of topics and will show you how to build a future-proof, performance driven website from start to finish.

This presentation was somewhat of a response to a few of the “RWD is slow” posts floating around. Related:

Reluctant to put this one on here because I felt like it was a little too snarky (even for me), but disappointly enough it’s been [7 months since that tweet and we still don’t have consensus](http://filamentgroup.com/lab/ricg_update/).

## NebraskaJS

[NebraskaJS](http://nebraskajs.com/) added over 150 new members to the group and had its most successful meetup yet—[86 JavaScripters learning about AngularJS](http://www.meetup.com/nebraskajs/events/113451292/)! In 2013, we had 7 meetings averaging 65 registrations per meeting (not including our awesome Christmas party).
