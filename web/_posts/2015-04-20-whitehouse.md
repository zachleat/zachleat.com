About one month ago, I received the following e-mail:

On April 17, we’re hosting community organizers, city and state officials, and technology thought leaders for a Tech Meetup at the White House. Our goals in gathering are to support America’s innovators, to better bridge digital divides, to interconnect us on common topics, to better collaborate on challenging projects where we have deep need and passion to solve them, and figure out how to include all Americans everywhere in our #InnovationNation.

I hope you will be able to join us!

Megan
U.S. Chief Technology Officer and Assistant to the President

To which I promptly responded:

Dear <span class="redacted">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>,

Please forgive my abruptness, but I’m sure I’m not the only one that has had this reaction—is this a real thing? Is it really at the White House?

Thanks!
Zach

I received the following:

Hello Zach! This is the real thing :) -- and no, you are not the only person to react this way. It's a very special invitation, and yes, we are all really, truly invited to the White House.

Holy shit.

Later I discovered that they wanted me to do a very short talk (three minutes) about [NebraskaJS](http://nebraskajs.com/).

Holy shit.

After my talk was over, I immediately posted this tweet:

## Thank You Notes

This was, without a doubt, one of the coolest opportunities I have ever had in my life. A huge thank you to the Meetup team that organized the event and [Megan Smith](https://twitter.com/USCTO) (US CTO) who I learned firsthand is one of the most amazing people on planet Earth.

Another huge thank you to everyone that has helped out with NebraskaJS: especially the original founders [Jonathan Sharp](https://twitter.com/jdsharp), [Andrew Wirick](https://twitter.com/amwirick), and [Eli Perelman](https://twitter.com/eliperelman); the current co-organizers [Nick Nisi](https://twitter.com/nicknisi) and [Blaine Kasten](https://twitter.com/blainekasten); and [all the presenters](http://nebraskajs.com/presenters/). I wouldn’t have gotten this opportunity if it hadn’t been for you all. Thank you.
