Here is a [presentation][1] given by a guy named Victor Tsaran on how he personally uses screen readers to browse the web. As web developers, accessibility is an important aspect of our work and cannot be ignored. How many websites have you browsed that had flash navigation? If you’re not a web developer, you need to skip ahead to time stamp 25:44 to see the mega-fast speed this guy uses the screen reader at. I couldn’t understand a single word coming out of my speaker.
