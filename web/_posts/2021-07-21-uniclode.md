<div class="primarylink">Demo: <a href="https://uniclode.zachleat.dev/">uniclode.zachleat.dev</a></div>

Here we find ourselves again, with yet another demo of [Eleventy Serverless](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/). You may already be familiar with [Rainglow](https://rainglow.zachleat.dev/), first showcased at the [Eleventy Meetup](https://www.11tymeetup.dev/). Uniclode shared that debut.

[Uniclode](https://uniclode.zachleat.dev/) is a zero-clientside JavaScript application that lets the end user select individual characters to generate a `unicode-range` value that can be used in font subsetting.

On first page render, each individual character is a hyperlink containing a new `unicode-range` set containing the current `unicode-range` of characters with the addition of itself.

When the links are clicked and the page is re-rendered, all of the link `href` attributes are recalculated. If a character is already present in the `unicode-range`, the hyperlink will contain a new set that has it removed. If a character is not yet in the `unicode-range`, the hyperlink will add it.

This is an interesting use case for Eleventy Serverless, in that it maintains state in the URL and re-renders the template based on that state. One might argue that this is a state machine, but I will not be pressured into assuming that role.

This demo shows that multiple URL paths can be assigned to a single serverless template, e.g.:

```
---
permalink:
  serverless: ["/", "/:chars/"]
---
```

This demo also makes use of [On-demand Builders](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/on-demand-builders/). That means that once a template is generated for a specific `unicode-range`, it will serve that cached page instead of re-rendering. This saves on both Netlify Functions quotas and run-time performance.

While this is a fully-functioning demo, I would consider it to be a demo and not a finished product. For this use case specifically, full page refreshes to select a character in a list is not the best-case UX. What this does show is that Eleventy Serverless allows a new class of projects to be built with a progressive enhancement friendly baseline that previously weren’t possible with static build-time templates alone.
