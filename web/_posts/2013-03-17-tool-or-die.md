> “Tool and die makers are a class of machinists who work primarily in toolroom environments—…often in an environment with flexible, semipermeable boundaries from production work.”
>
> These are the people that make the tools to make the products. This was the environment I grew up in—watching my father work as a tool and die maker. He could make anything! But more importantly, he knew the value of good tools—even if you had to construct them yourself.
> 
> Tools are important and tooling for Web Development is improving! I’ll go through a few of my favorites: Node.js, grunt.js, npm, yepnope, SASS, grunticon, Browser devtools, Testing tools, and others.

Cory House was quick off the blocks with a [review of all the talks he attended](http://www.bitnative.com/2013/03/17/nebraska-code-camp-2013-lessons-learned/):

> Zach laid out his presentation in a unique way, relying totally on hand-made lean HTML markup that slowly blossomed as he walked us through topics. I really enjoyed this iterative and novel approach – it was the perfect choice for such a markup heavy session.
