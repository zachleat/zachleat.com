_Warning: In this post I will be tooting a horn that is my horn. The horn is mine and I will be the one that is tooting it. I know that when there is a horn, the person tooting the horn should ideally not be the person that owns the horn. I would be much more comfortable tooting a horn that is someone else’s horn. But I have been put into this uncomfortable position by someone taking my horn and tooting it. Mostly I just want Eleventy to be useful and this convinces people to try it out. Sorry (not sorry)._

Eleventy won a Google award! It’s great validation for the project and I sincerely appreciate it—**thank you**! Lots of great projects on that list and I’m delighted to see Eleventy mixed in there. 😍

> Twice a year Googlers nominate open source contributors outside of the company for their contributions to open source projects, including those used by Google. Nominees are reviewed by a team of volunteers and the winners receive our heartfelt thanks with a token of our appreciation.
