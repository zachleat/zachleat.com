When you preload, you’re racing for the request to finish before first paint. Subsetting helps there too. So it’s certainly not foolproof, but the theme of this blog post was “quick improvement” and not something I would consider a best practice for something in a more professional setting / client work / my own web site 👀. As preload and font-display browser support broadens though, that could change.</p>","replies":[]}]},{"postId":"3641917492","parentPostId":null,"date":"2017-12-01T18:38:15Z","author":"Jason Maggard","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f2b526358ce92b4ee48178b6b49c85e1?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>WOW!
