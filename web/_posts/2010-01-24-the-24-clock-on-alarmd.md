If you’re only using @font-face for titles and text, you’re missing out on a whole [wealth of use cases][1] that have yet to be explored. For instance, I created a very simple [7 Segment Display Numeric font][2] to be used for a skin on [alarmd.com][3] and changed the color using nothing but CSS to create the “24″ Clock (true fans will note that the actual font is italic and [has a serif on the 1][4]). Nonetheless, this is just another useful application of @font-face.

Take a look at the [Dingbats section on fontsquirrel][5] to get your brain going in the same direction.
