This quote from [Sarah Drasner (@sarah_edo)](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) floated into my stream.

I thought, wait—I *would* want to do that! Let’s build it!

* But instead of 30 web fonts, let’s use 100.
* And we’ll load them in a random order.
* And we’ll get rid of the FOIT for each one.
* And we’ll subset them so that our 100 web fonts only add up to ~100KB total weight.
* And we’ll use `vmax` (the larger of `1vw` or `1vh`) with `font-size` so the [text scales with the viewport](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/).

Randsom has a white list of script-style typefaces gathered from the Google Web Fonts service. For each character in the sample text, we take a random typeface and load a web font containing only that character in the content. Each web font is approximately 1KB (on average).

We use the CSS Font Loading API to prevent FOIT using the [FOUT with a Class method](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#fout-class). After a web font has loaded and displayed for a second, the process is repeated with a new typeface from the list. When all 100 web fonts have been used, no further action is taken on the page.

Interestingly, originally the script was intended to re-use web fonts from the list, loading different characters with a new request every time in an infinite loop. This probably could have been achieved using `unicode-range` on the Google Web Fonts `@font-face` block and in the CSS Font Loading API, coupled with a unique class in the FOUT with a Class font loading method. However—I didn’t take this experiment that far. It simply quits when all the fonts have been used, which seems like a safer method anyway considering an infinite loop could be characterized as a Google Web Fonts DDoS.

## With thanks to

* [Google Web Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and especially their [`text` query parameter to subset](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#optimizing_your_font_requests_beta) the web fonts.
* [Filament Group’s loadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/) to asynchronously load the stylesheets from Google Web Fonts. The web fonts are loaded asynchronously using the [CSS Font Loading API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-loading). So if you’re wondering why this looks totally bland in Microsoft Edge—Edge doesn’t support the CSS Font Loading API.
* [Charming.js](https://github.com/yuanqing/charming), a no-dependency implementation of [Lettering.js](https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js)
