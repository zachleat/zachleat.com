When you add an alarm source to [ALARMd, the Internet Alarm Clock][1], it will now default to opening the input URL in a new window, if the URL is determined not to be an MP3, Youtube video, or a LAST.FM user or tag.

I added this to use [maLArquee][2] as an alarm. For instance you can try adding this one to your ALARMd for a nice wake up message.

Of course the obvious downfall of this approach is that your target website would need sound if you wanted to actually use it to wake up. But you could also use it to open up a new window at a specific time to prank a friend, coworker, or loved one. Try setting up ALARMd to use a naked lady website as a target url on your coworkers computer and set the time for right after lunch! Or open ALARMd up on your colleague’s computer and get it to open a competitor’s website during a big presentation to the company president.

Fun to be had by all, I’m sure.
