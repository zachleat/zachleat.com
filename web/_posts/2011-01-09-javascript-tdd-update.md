***Update**: [The JavaScript Testing Challenge Winner][1]*

 [1]: /web/2011/02/14/javascript-tdd-winner/

In [The JavaScript Testing Challenge][2], I asked JavaScript developers of the world to change their heathen ways and embrace the future of automated testing for a healthier and brighter tomorrow.

However, due to seasonal timing or otherwise real life related reasons, the challenge was greeted with a worldwide chorus of universally blank stares. So, in the true spirit of Christmas, I’m removing the deadline and **will award the grand prize to the developer with the first correct and complete PrimeFactors code kata screencast**. That’s right, be the first to answer the challenge will win a copy of Test-Driven JavaScript Development by Christian Johansen (PDF or Print version, your choice).

If you have any questions or need help getting started, let me know! I’d be glad to help. Good luck!

*Time of entry will be based on the twitter at message sent to @zachleat. Full restrictions and rules posted [here][2].*
