title: CSS Naked Day

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s been a few years since it was A Thing, true, but the most recent CSS Naked Day was held on the ninth of April. Anyone else interested in reviving the practice this Thursday? It’ll speed up your site!

While it seems that I’ve personally outgrown using “sexy” to describe anything related to web development _(eww)_, I do like the impetus behind the CSS naked day movement!

So for today my site will be sans-CSS. Enjoy!
