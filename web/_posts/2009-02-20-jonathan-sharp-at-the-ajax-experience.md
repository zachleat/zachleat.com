Former co-worker and all around good guy Jonathan Sharp gave a presentation at The Ajax Experience about a project that he developed, and subsequently passed onto me around 3Q2008. A custom built UI component library based on jQuery, used by 450+ developers on 80+ internal and external web applications. You wouldn’t think it, but railroads have pretty large IT departments. This presentation was [posted on Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/archives/jquery-ajax-experience-framework-videos) this week. Enjoy!
