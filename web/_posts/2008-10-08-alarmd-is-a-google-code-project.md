**Update: [ALARMd has been moved to GitHub](/web/alarmd-is-now-on-github/).**

I received a request this week to participate in development of the internet alarm clock I developed awhile back called [ALARMd][1]. It has gone through two major revisions, and my interest in contributing additional source code to the project is waning. I’ve got [other projects][2]. So, I’ve decided to publish it to Google Code. I won’t be doing new development on the project, but will accept patches and commits to the repository. Feel free to ask me for project member status.
