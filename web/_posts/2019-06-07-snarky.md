I had the pleasure of attending an [IndieWebCamp](https://indieweb.org/) before the amazing [Beyond Tellerrand](https://beyondtellerrand.com/) conference a few weeks back and I’m still [buzzing](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1127489938448977920) from the experience.

I can’t really express how meaningful this experience was to me. An antithesis to the rat race of social media, IndieWebCamp was a roomful of kindred spirits that care about the web and their own websites and hosting their own content. It felt like the Google Reader days again, when everyone was blogging and writing on their own sites. I dunno if you can tell but I loved it. If you get the chance to attend one of these events, jump on it (I really want to run one in Omaha 👀).

## Webmentions, Disqus, Wordpress

At the event I got a working example of [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) going on my personal web site. I already had [a static copy of my old Disqus comments that I’d exported](/web/disqus-import/) (which included copies of old Wordpress comments that I’d imported into Disqus 😎).

Webmentions are made possible for static web sites when you use [webmention.io](https://webmention.io/), a service to log incoming entries. Another service, [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/), crawls social networking sites for mentions of my site and sends those over to webmention.io automatically.

If I’ve already lost you, luckily [Max Böck wrote up a lovely tutorial on how to do this using Eleventy](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/) (his site is amazing, too). Max also created an [`eleventy-webmentions` starter project](https://github.com/maxboeck/eleventy-webmentions) which has all the code for this. Hopefully we can get some form of this merged back into the upstream `eleventy-base-blog` too.

You can see an example of how the webmentions look on my site at one of my recent blog posts: [Google Fonts is Adding `font-display`](/web/google-fonts-display/#webmentions).

## Sentiment Analysis

Hosting my own content and comments allows me to be a bit more creative with it. So I decided to take this a step further and have [a little fun](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1132727088031653891) with negative comments.

First, how do we find out if a comment is negative? Let’s try to use [Natural, a plugin on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural). I added a Liquid filter to my [Eleventy configuration file](https://www.11ty.io/docs/config/) to analyze text and spit out a sentiment value. `0` is neutral, `< 0` is negative, and `> 0` is positive. Note that this natural language processing isn’t 100% (sometimes I’ll get a false positive) but this is just a fun demo on my site.

```js
const Natural = require('natural');
const analyze = new Natural.SentimentAnalyzer("English", Natural.PorterStemmer, "afinn");

module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
    eleventyConfig.addLiquidFilter("getSentimentValue", function(content) {
        if( content ) {
            const tokenizer = new Natural.WordTokenizer();
            return analyze.getSentiment(tokenizer.tokenize(content));
        }

        return 0;
    });
};
```

And then in my Liquid template, I use this integer value to add a `static-comments-reply-salty` class:

```
{%- raw -%}
{% assign sentiment = webmention.content.text | getSentimentValue %}
<li class="static-comments-reply{% if sentiment < 0 %} static-comments-reply-salty{% endif %}">
    …
{%- endraw -%}
```

And then in my stylesheet, I use this class to opt-into a lovely stack of Comic Sans, Chalkboard, and of course a fantasy fallback for kicks:

```css
.static-comments-reply-salty {
    font-family: Comic Sans MS, Chalkboard SE, fantasy;
}
```

As extra credit, I also used the [`random-case` plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-case) to `mODifY tHe TeXt` (at [David Darnes excellent recommendation](https://twitter.com/DavidDarnes/status/1132732852196511744)).

## How does it look?

This was taken from a real comment on my site.

### Before:

<div class="livedemo" data-demo-label="Snarky Comment">
    <ol class="static-comments static-comments-webmentions">
        <li class="static-comments-reply">
            <div class="static-comments-hed">
                <img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38e4a1731159a21bbce9890693c81380?d=mm&amp;s=60" class="static-comments-img">
                <h3 class="static-comments-title cased">Jeez Louise <span class="tag-inline" title="Readonly Comment Archived from Disqus (Disqus has been removed from this site)">Disqus</span></h3>
                <em class="static-comments-date"><a>22 Feb 2015 at 12:03PM</a></em>
            </div>
            <div class="static-comments-msg"><p>Hey man, you need to fix this or take it down.  Don't you see how many people are complaining that it doesn't work?</p></div>
            <ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

### After:

<div class="livedemo" data-demo-label="Snarky Comment">
    <ol class="static-comments static-comments-webmentions">
        <li class="static-comments-reply static-comments-reply-salty">
            <div class="static-comments-hed">
                <img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38e4a1731159a21bbce9890693c81380?d=mm&amp;s=60" class="static-comments-img">
                <h3 class="static-comments-title cased">Jeez Louise <span class="tag-inline" title="Readonly Comment Archived from Disqus (Disqus has been removed from this site)">Disqus</span></h3>
                <em class="static-comments-date"><a>22 Feb 2015 at 12:03PM</a></em>
            </div>
            <div class="static-comments-msg"><p>heY mAN, yOu nEEd TO fix ThIs Or TaKE IT Down. don'T YoU SeE hOw MAnY PeOplE arE cOmPlaIning thAt iT DOEsN't WorK?</p></div>
            <ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

This isn’t intended to be a hot-take on Comic Sans. Instead it’s meant to change the tone of the negativity to make it sound like a clown is yelling at a kid’s birthday party.
