title: Google Using YUI Grids CSS

Head over to the [Google Homepage][1]. Log In using your Google Account. Make sure you’re at your [Personalized Homepage][1]. Take a look at the source CSS file [ig.css][2] included on the page. There are a few peculiar lines of code that I recognized from another source, the Yahoo User Interface Grids CSS file. Yahoo has provided a set of standard CSS definitions under the BSD license that allow a developer to easily make fluid or fixed width column layouts. And on the Google Personalized Homepage, there are the following class definitions:

 [1]: http://www.google.com/ig?hl=en
 [2]: http://www.google.com/ig/f/tB22vfBbv0g/ig.css

``` css
#modules .yui-b{position:static;display:block;margin:0 0 1em 0;float:none;width:auto;overflow:hidden;}
.yui-gb .yui-u{float:left;margin-left:2%;*margin-left:1.895%;width:32%;}
.yui-gb div.first{margin-left:0;}
#modules,.yui-gb{zoom:1;}
```

This code includes identical Class names taken from the [Yahoo User Interface library Grids CSS][3] component. Here is the source in the [grids.css][4] file from Yahoo (truncated for simplicity).

 [3]: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/
 [4]: http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.2.0/build/grids/grids-min.css

``` css
#yui-main .yui-b{position:static;}
.yui-t7 #yui-main .yui-b {
  display:block;margin:0 0 1em 0;
}
#yui-main .yui-b {float:none;width:auto;}
.yui-gb .yui-u{float:left;margin-left:2%;*margin-left:1.895%;width:32%;}
.yui-gb div.first{margin-left:0;}
#bd,.yui-gb{zoom:1;}
```

Obviously, it’s the same code, with a few minor differences.

The interesting thing to note is that the YUI Grids CSS source code is licensed under a [BSD license][6], which includes the following provisions:

 [6]: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html

> Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the
> following disclaimer.

The copyright notice they’re referring to is not included anywhere on the Google Personalized Homepage (and would seem to be a violation of the license). Now this may seem like a small infraction when we’re just talking about 4 lines of CSS code. But really, if they think the code is good enough that they will use it in such a prominent way and not write it from scratch using their own means, they should follow the licensing agreements stipulated.

**Update**
Google has added the BSD license statement and attribution to Yahoo in their CSS file ([ig.css][2]):

``` css

#modules .yui-b {
  position:static;
  display:block;
  margin:0 0 1em 0;
  float:none;
  width:auto;
  overflow:hidden;
}
.yui-gb .yui-u {
  float:left;
  margin-left:2%;
  *margin-left:1.895%;
  width:32%;
}
.yui-gb div.first {
  margin-left:0;
}
#modules,.yui-gb {
  zoom:1;
}

```

Sorry to everyone visiting the page for the extra millisecond or two it will take to load these comments.
