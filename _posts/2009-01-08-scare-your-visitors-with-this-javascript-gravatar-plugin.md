![Tournology Blog Comment Form][3]

Here’s a use case. An unregistered visitor visits your blog, and decides that your **content is so good that it merits a comment**! Congratulations, you’ve fooled them! Now you can [twply their account details for $1200 on Sitepoint][4]! Just kidding. But generally, when you visit a blog’s commenting section (such as the [Tournology Blog][5] shown above), you’ll see a simple form to authenticate you’re not a spammer, generally including (among other things) an e-mail address field.

![Tournology Blog Comment Form With Gravatar][6]

Well, since they’re typing their e-mail address, wouldn’t it be cool if we could **show them their gravatar** right there, inline with the blog comment form? Well, that’s now possible with my new **[JavaScript Gravatar Plugin][7]**! It doesn’t have any server side language dependencies.

![Gravatar Signup Page][8]

Hell, [gravatar.com][9] could even use this to **improve the user experience of registering your e-mail account**. Right now it does a full page refresh and doesn’t even show you a preview!

Showing all options, again onblur of email text input field.

    $('#email').blur(function(event) {
        $('body').append($.gravatar($(this).val(), {
            // integer size: between 1 and 512, default 80 (in pixels)
            size: 200,
            // maximum rating (in order of raunchiness, least to most): g (default), pg, r, x
            rating: 'pg',
            // url to define a default image (can also be one of: identicon, monsterid, wavatar)
            image: 'identicon'
        }));
    });
