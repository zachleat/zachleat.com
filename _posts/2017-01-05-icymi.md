Rather than a bunch of individual ‚ÄúIn Case You Missed It‚Äù tweets, I thought I‚Äôd repeat what I‚Äôve done the last three years ([2013](/web/icymi/2013/), [2014](/web/icymi/2014/), [2015](/web/icymi/2015/)) and just do one big yearly semi-comprehensive recap of the web community things that I did this year.

## Blog Posts

Top five posts written in 2016 ordered by 2016 page views and a bonus post because I have no idea how much traffic perfplanet gets.

## NEJSCONF

<img src="/web/img/posts/2016-icymi/nejsconf-2016-crowd.jpg" alt="The attendees at NEJSCONF 2016">

Our sophomore conference came after our [sold-out first event last year in 2015](http://2015.nejsconf.com/). Our [2016 train themed single day single track conference](https://nejsconf.com/) sold out again with 200 attendees. We were excited to have an open call for proposals, a board game after party, and again blended both international and local speakers including keynotes from [Justin Searls](https://nejsconf.com/speakers/keynote-justin-searls/) and [Andrea Goulet](https://nejsconf.com/speakers/keynote-andrea-goulet/). Check out these [awesome event photos](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN4nlFYmhJASQMXNM5uQcrrPnST97uIsrF1BG30pRYOFdfTHDbucj0U7GrtegWywA?key=Qlh3NzlKSEFjb25GbGZKempNbVVVR283U3pTWm9n) from [Andrew Neely](https://twitter.com/ravinglogic).

## NebraskaJS


This is my fifth year as co-organizer of [NebraskaJS](http://www.meetup.com/nebraskajs/). In 2015 we had 12 different meetups in Lincoln and Omaha, not counting the two [TechOmaha](http://techomaha.com/) developer group co-op parties, and a screening of [What Comes Next is the Future](http://www.futureisnext.com/) at the Alamo Drafthouse (with huge thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/kathyia">Kathy Andersen</a> for <a href="https://futureisnext.splashthat.com/">spearheading the event</a>). We added 207 meetup members in 2016 and broke the 1,000 mark this year‚Äîamazing!

## Talks

This year I decided to slow it down on public speaking. Nonetheless I did two small talks this year (neither of which are available online). The first was a [NebraskaJS talk](https://www.meetup.com/nebraskajs/events/235243306/) which ended up being about the dangers of media queries in re-usable component libraries (spoiler: we need container/element queries, stat). The second was a [satirical talk at Barcamp Omaha](https://zachleat.com/twitter/776789550420996096) about the spread of misinformation online called ‚ÄúThe Earth is Flat‚ÄîSeparating Fact from Fiction on the Internet.‚Äù I originally planned to publish this one but when some flat-earthers messaged me on Twitter hoping that I‚Äôd help their cause, I learned something valuable about satire and changed my mind. Y‚Äôall‚Äîwe can‚Äôt even poke fun at Flat Earthers without signal boosting them. Ugh.

## Open Source

* Created [faux-pas](https://github.com/filamentgroup/faux-pas), a bookmarklet to highlight faux-rendered (bold or italic) and otherwise misconfigured webfonts (node/grunt/gulp components for this are coming soon).
* [`browser-logo-icon-set`](https://github.com/zachleat/browser-logo-icon-set) is a grunticon icon set of multicolor vector/bitmap web browser logos ([Demo](https://zachleat.github.io/browser-logo-icon-set/usage.html)).
* Contributed a tiny PR to [bramstein/stateofwebtype](https://github.com/bramstein/stateofwebtype).
* Researched and filed four new issues on [Scott Jehl‚Äôs `device-bugs` repo](https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs/issues/created_by/zachleat).
* Created a repo for people to [AMA](https://github.com/zachleat/ama/).
* A bunch of other contributions to various Filament Group open source libraries that I won‚Äôt list individually.
