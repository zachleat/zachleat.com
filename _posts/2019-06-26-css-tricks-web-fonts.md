When [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/) asked me to look at the font loading behavior for the new redesign of CSS-Tricks, Iâ€™ll admit that I was excited. A new case study on a web site with an intimidating, exhaustive, encyclopedic amount of existing web development content!

## Design Review

When doing any web font strategy recommendation, the first thing I like to do is have a look at the design. I want to know where and how the typefaces are being used in the design in order to give appropriate advice on how they should be loaded. Luckily, Chris gave me a sneak peek at what I was dealing with.

The new design uses the [Rubik typeface, available on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik). Thatâ€™s exciting, as most of the typefaces available on Google Fonts have open licenses and this was no exception: Rubik uses the [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL_web), which gives us license ðŸ˜Ž to make the modifications we need to optimize the font for the CSS-Tricks web site.

As Chris has helpfully annotated above, the design has three different weights of Rubik in play: Regular (`normal` or `400`), Medium (`500`), and Bold (`700`).

The next step I took was to code up a quick prototype to double-check that the annotations were correct. I overlaid the prototype on top of the screenshot to make sure things lined up properly. While I didnâ€™t have access to the coded prototype, I was mostly worried that the body copy was using a web font that we hadnâ€™t discussedâ€”but luckily was able to determine that the body copy was using `system-ui` (not a web font).

<img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/design-overlay.png" alt="">

There was one small problem. That Medium (`500` weight) wasnâ€™t rightâ€”it was actually a Regular (`400`) in disguise!

The design:

<img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/400-500a.png" alt="" class="sm-img">

`font-weight: 500` and `font-weight: 400`:

<img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/400-500b.png" alt="" class="sm-img">

font-weight: 400 for both:

<img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/400-500c.png" alt="" class="sm-img">

That will save us one font file!

From our design and prototype, we now know that we have two font files that are important here: Rubik Regular and Rubik Bold. Next letâ€™s take a peak at those files to see what weâ€™re working with.

## Rubik Deep Dive

Another great thing about Google Fonts is that they provide easy download links for all of their typefaces. Letâ€™s download the zip for [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?selection.family=Rubik):

<img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/googlefonts.png" alt="">

<img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/downloaded.png" alt="">

The download gives us a zip file with ten hefty TrueType fonts from the Rubik typeface.

## The Merits of Two Stage Font Loading

Iâ€™ve written about the benefits to using two stage font loading before:

- [Flash of Faux Text](https://www.zachleat.com/web/foft/) (2015)
- [Critical Web Fonts](https://www.zachleat.com/web/critical-webfonts/) (2016)
- [A Comprehensive Guide to Font Loading Strategies](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/), the last 4 methods (2016)

The entire point of implementing a two stage font loading strategy is to mitigate text movement associated with web fonts when they finish loading and reflow the text on the page. By dividing your font load into a smaller chunk and a larger lazy loaded chunk, we can minimize and mitigate the impact of web fonts to end users. Iâ€™m not necessarily on team FOIT (invisible text) or team FOUT (fallback text)â€”both are bad.

In the past Iâ€™ve recommended two stage font loading strategies that were all-in on JavaScript. However, with burgeoning `font-display` browser support we can take advantage of `font-display` to deliver a good web font experience without JavaScript! Importantly, o*ur First Stage must be feature-inclusive enough to be self sufficient if the JavaScript fonts arenâ€™t loaded.*

With our two stage font loading, we must make some hard choices about what we want to load in our first stage. To know how to make those choices, we need to know what is available to usâ€”letâ€™s inspect these fonts!

## Wakamai Fondue

One of the best tools Iâ€™ve found for inspecting a web fontâ€™s internals is called [Wakamai Fondue](https://wakamaifondue.com/) (What Can My Font Do?) by [Roel Nieskens (@PixelAmbacht)](https://twitter.com/pixelambacht/).

Wakamai Fondue works transparently with WOFF and WOFF2 files tooâ€”which makes it a nice replacement for Mac OS X Preview until Preview gets support for those formats. Itâ€™s really great. Letâ€™s drag and drop the `Rubik-Bold.ttf` file we just downloaded and take a peek inside.

<img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/wakamai-fondue.png" alt="">

Wakamai Fondue shows that Rubik Bold (140KB TTF, 46KB WOFF2 compressed) has 686 characters and a bunch of fancy OpenType features:

- Fractions, Numeric Subscripts and Superscripts, and Ordinals <img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/features1.png" alt="" class="sm-img"><img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/features2.png" alt="" class="sm-img"><img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/features3.png" alt="" class="sm-img"><img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/features4.png" alt="" class="sm-img">
- Ligatures <img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/features5.png" alt="" class="sm-img"><img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/features6.png" alt="" class="sm-img">
- Case-Sensitive Forms <img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/features7.png" alt="" class="sm-img">
- All of the above OpenType features only cost us **2.9KB WOFF2 (6% of the total)**
- Kerning: **9.7KB WOFF2 cost (21.6% of the total)**
- Hinting: **11.5KB WOFF2 cost (25.7% of the total)** (note that Hinting not yet reported by Wakamai Fondueâ€”Roel consider this a feature request, please!)

(WOFF2 size costs calculated using `pyftsubset` with `--layout-features` with `--no-hinting --desubroutinize` for hinting size)

The nice thing here is that you customize what you want on the first stage and what you want on the second stage to your use case and preferences. Just know that the more you put into the First Stage, the more likely the user will either experience longer First Render delays (due to heavy `preload` cost) or longer FOUT times (as fallback text is shown while waiting for First Stage to complete).

## Two Stage Choices for CSS-Tricks:

**First Stage**

- Kerning
    - While this is one of the heftier parts of our font, it *does* affect text movement if itâ€™s not available up front. You may choose to defer this to the second stageâ€”thatâ€™s fine! Just be aware of how much your text moves when it lazy loads in.
- Subset to Latin Character Set: 221 characters of the total 686 available to us. This seems to be a standard unicode range across many of Googleâ€™s Fontsâ€”so this range was borrowed directly from the Google Fonts CSS ðŸ˜Ž.

Hereâ€™s the `pyftsubset` command (from [fonttools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools)) I used to generate first stage font files:

```bash
pyftsubset "Rubik-Bold.ttf" --output-file="Rubik-Bold-kern-latin.woff2" --flavor=woff2 --layout-features=ccmp,locl,mark,mkmk,kern --no-hinting --desubroutinize --unicodes=U+0000-00FF,U+0131,U+0152-0153,U+02BB-02BC,U+02C6,U+02DA,U+02DC,U+2000-206F,U+2074,U+20AC,U+2122,U+2191,U+2193,U+2212,U+2215,U+FEFF,U+FFFD

# Run again using "Rubik-Regular.ttf"
# To generate woff files, use `--flavor=woff`
# You may recognize the other `--layout-features=ccmp,locl,mark,mkmk` from the Required Layout Features section on Wakamai Fondue.
```

First stage file size results:

- **13.9KB** for `Rubik-Bold-kern-latin.woff2`
- **13.9KB** for `Rubik-Regular-kern-latin.woff2`

**Second Stage**

- Fancy OpenType features (Ligatures, Fractions, Subscript and Superscript, etc)
    - OpenType features are some of the coolest web font tech and they largely go unused. Worse, if youâ€™re loading Rubik from Google Fonts they prune most of them out! However, these features are clearly all Nice To Havesâ„¢ and as such weâ€™ve deferred them to our second stage load.
- Hinting: extra instructions to fit individual glyphs to the available pixel grid
    - This may be a contentious choice as Mac OS largely ignores hinting so it isnâ€™t used.
    - Some have argued that as screen resolutions get finer, hinting is increasingly unnecessary. You may even be tempted to hide this behind a [`resolution` media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/resolution)â€”but note that hinting (when used) is still important for small font sizes, which may or may not be relevant to your design.
    - Option: you may want to remove this altogether. Add `--no-hinting --desubroutinize` to your `pyftsubset` command below to remove it.
- The remaining character set. Our first stage only loaded 221 characters, so letâ€™s load the remaining 465 available in the Rubik typeface.
    - Option: you may want to second stage with a smaller subset of characters if your content allows it. Customize with `--unicodes`. Have a look at a project I maintain called [GlyphHanger](https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger) that takes a URL as input and spits out the `unicode-range` of characters used on that URL (it does a lot of other things too).

`pyfsubset` command (from [fonttools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools)) to generate second stage font files:

    pyftsubset "Rubik-Bold.ttf" --output-file="Rubik-Bold-hint-all.woff2" --flavor=woff2 --layout-features="*" --unicodes=U+0-10FFFF

    # Run again using "Rubik-Regular.ttf"
    # To generate woff files, use `--flavor=woff`

Second stage file size results:

- **44.7KB** for `Rubik-Bold-hint-all.woff2`
- **44KB** for `Rubik-Regular-hint-all.woff2`

## Give Me Something to Copy and Paste

Most of the work up to this point was a large discussion about how to prioritize different features for our two stage load, but the code to implement this is really quite easy. Here are the pieces:

**Preload HTML for First Stage**

Preload will affect first render times, remove this if you would rather have FOUT ðŸ˜± (please donâ€™t).

```html
<link rel="preload" href="Rubik-Bold-kern-latin.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" href="Rubik-Regular-kern-latin.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
```

**CSS for First Stage (inline in `<head>`)**

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: Rubik;
    src: url(Rubik-Bold-kern-latin.woff2) format("woff2"),
       url(Rubik-Bold-kern-latin.woff) format("woff");
    font-weight: 700;
    font-display: swap;
}
@font-face {
    font-family: Rubik;
    src: url(Rubik-Regular--kern-latin.woff2) format("woff2"),
       url(Rubik-Regular-kern-latin.woff) format("woff");
    font-weight: 400;
    font-display: swap;
}
```

We could add our subset `unicode-range` value we used above in our glyphhanger command, but it would not have any functional value. A few reasons for this:

1. Our second stage will not be a distinct set of glyphs, itâ€™s a superset of the first stage glyphs.
2. Our second stage has other features that we donâ€™t (or canâ€™t yet) feature test for, namely hinting. See this [proposal for a `uses-hints` media query](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3926).

**JavaScript for Second Stage**

You can put this wherever youâ€™d like. I like to inline it into the `<head>` too but you may have other high priority requests youâ€™d like to load before these.

```js
if( "fonts" in document ) {
    var regular = new FontFace("Rubik", "url(Rubik-Regular-hint-all.woff2) format('woff2'), url(Rubik-Regular-hint-all.woff) format('woff')");
    var bold = new FontFace("Rubik", "url(Rubik-Bold-hint-all.woff2) format('woff2'), url(Rubik-Bold-hint-all.woff) format('woff')", { weight: "700" });

    Promise.all([ bold.load(), regular.load() ]).then(function(fonts) {
        fonts.forEach(function(font) {
            document.fonts.add(font);
        });
    });
}
```

Notably if the browser doesnâ€™t support the [CSS Font Loading API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=font-loading) (read: Edge/Internet Explorer) they will only see the First Stage web font load (whichâ€”rememberâ€”we specifically architected to be sufficient and is a fine compromise here). If you disagree (and itâ€™s reasonable to do  so as this approach means that IE and Edge wonâ€™t get Hinting), use the following block too:

```js
if(!("fonts" in document) && "head" in document) {
    // Awkwardly dump the second stage @font-face blocks in the head
    var style = document.createElement("style");
    // Note: Edge supports WOFF2
    style.innerHTML = "@font-face { font-family: Rubik; src: url(/rubik/Rubik-Regular-hint-all.woff2) format('woff2'), url(/rubik/Rubik-Regular-hint-all.woff) format('woff'); } @font-face { font-family: Rubik; font-weight: 700; src: url(/rubik/Rubik-Bold-hint-all.woff2) format('woff2'), url(/rubik/Rubik-Bold-hint-all.woff) format('woff'); }";
    document.head.appendChild(style);
}
```

_Update to use `document.head` per an excellent recommendation from [@simaodeveloper](https://twitter.com/simaodeveloper/status/1149032206318342147)._

## Additional Optimizations and Options

- Put our four web font URLs into your Service Worker, if you have one!
- Want to add true italics?
    - Option 1: Add them to both the first stage and the second stage, using the same methodology presented above. Keep in mind: if you preload too much, you pay in first render time.
    - Option 2 (my recommendation): Add the full version only to the second stage and let the first stage use font-synthesis to fake italics until the full version has loaded.

## How does this load?

For the most part, our performance profile will largely depend on how the CSS is loaded. If we add the current [HTTP Archive average CSS weight of 50KB](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesCss), using preload (with Fast 3G and 6x CPU slowdown in Chrome Devtools), our first stage loads before first render! This means (for this example) no FOUT! Hereâ€™s how our demo looks after the first stage is complete.

- Live Demo hosted on [https://css-tricks-font-loading.netlify.com/](https://css-tricks-font-loading.netlify.com/)

**First Stage**

Any OpenType features will display their unsupported versions while we wait for the second stage to complete. Any text rendering that relies on hinting will be unhinted (for now). Any non-Latin characters will display fallbacks.

<img src="/web/img/posts/css-tricks/first-stage.png" alt="">

**Second Stage**

All the OpenType features available in the original font, hinting as the designer intended (not depicted in this screenshot), true non-Latin characters.

## Conclusion

If I were given liberties with the design, I would recommend removing Rubik Regular from the font loading altogether. It certainly isnâ€™t pulling as much weight as Rubik Bold is here and it might be safe to switch to use `system-ui` for these design elements as well.

For most headlines, youâ€™re unlikely to notice that a second stage is loading at all. Iâ€™ve used a dramatic case here to demonstrate whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes. But this sneakiness is idealâ€”we want to transparently populate our cache (and/or serviceworker) with these second stage files so that they are available when they are needed for these extended character set scenarios.

The wins here are numerous compared with a Google Fonts implementation:

- Google Fonts uses two different domains to load the content, one for the CSS and one for the font files. This is not ideal. We eliminate these extra hops and connection setups by self hosting. Our demo renders our first stage web font content more than 600ms (Fast 3G) before a similar Google Fonts demo would.
- No invisible text, even if a font request is slower than expected (no FOIT!). ~~At time of writing, Google Fonts does not support `font-display` to make our text immediately visible.~~ [Google Fonts added `font-display` support](/web/google-fonts-display/)!
- We use `preload` to mitigate most text movement on our pageâ€”in many cases this means no fallback text is shown (no FOUT!). At time of writing, Google Fonts does not support `preload` as the font file URLs on their service are not stable.
- We use the CSS Font Loading API to group our second stage font loadings into a single repaint and reflow.

But perhaps most importantly we now have more controlâ€”we decide what features we want to load in our first and second stages to suit our design needs and performance requirements.
