> Build once, run everywhere.
> In this full-nerd, front-end-leaning episode of Podcast Awesome, Matt sits down with Zach Leatherman (creator of Eleventy) and Konnor Rogers (Web Awesome developer) to chat about how a static site generator just might be the key to building some of the most powerful, performant documentation on the web.
>
> We dig deep into Eleventy’s evolution, Web Awesome’s hybrid architecture, and how a team of devs found a way to keep docs fast, flexible, and secure — without rewriting everything from scratch or giving up on open source values. Spoiler: they didn’t go full ExpressJS for fun.
>
> Whether you’re a seasoned dev or a newb, this one's packed with insight, edge-case explorations, and some seriously satisfying build-time nerdery.
>
> In this episode, we explore:
> - ⚡️ Why Eleventy’s simplicity still scales
> - 🧠 Making static sites feel dynamic (without a heavy JS framework)
> - 🔐 How Web Awesome handles auth + private docs with minimal friction
> - 🚫 Avoiding vendor lock-in and runtime gotchas
> - 📦 The future of Eleventy in browsers, edge runtimes, and beyond
>
> Pull up your terminal. This one’s for you.
