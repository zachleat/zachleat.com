I was very fortunate to be invited to be the [Mystery Speaker at Smashing Conference](/web/smashingconf/2023/video/) in Freiburg this year! We really did trap hundreds of people in a room to teach them about web components 😈😈😈

Check out [the video of the talk: The Good, The Bad, The Web Components](/web/smashingconf/2023/video/)

## Talk Notes

A few quick points from some of the other talks at this event (I always try to watch as many as I can!):

### Slava Shestopalov

A reminder that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is creating more people that need accessible experiences—so investing in accessibility testing and improving those experiences in our work is one small way that we can do our part.

### Amy Hupe

1. “You can create really inaccessible experiences from accessible components.”
2. Design systems can create bias at scale!
3. You can’t retrofit inclusion!
4. Are simplicity and inclusion incompatible?

### Jecelyn Yeen

Have you ever struggled with a focusable element (custom drop down menu) that disappears when you swap focus to your Developer Tools? The [“Emulate a focused page” checkbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/rendering/apply-effects/#emulate-a-focused-page) is for you!

### Dan Donald

1. You don’t need to solve Big Tech Company problems, nor repeat their solutions.
2. The success of your design system is reflected in how successful the end users feel when interacting with the products created using the design system.

### Miriam Suzanne

1. Gave much needed historical attribution to Jen Simmons for their work on Intrinsic Web Design.
2. Reminded us that media queries aren’t going away even if container queries are ubiquitous. They’ll continue to be useful for non-size related things like `prefers-reduced-motion` and `hover`, etc.
3. [Style queries are coming](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/style-queries/) and they are awesome when used with Custom Properties.

### Christophe Porteneuve

1. New Array APIs that don’t mutate: `toReversed`, `toSorted`, `toSpliced`, `with` (already in Safari 16 and Node 20+).
2. There are new Set methods coming for `intersection`,  `difference`, `isSubsetOf`, `union`!
3. [ShadowRealm](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm) for sandboxed JavaScript execution will be very helpful in WebC too 👍🏻
