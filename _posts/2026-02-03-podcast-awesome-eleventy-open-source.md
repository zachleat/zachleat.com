> Eleventy started as a side project. Now it’s a critical infrastructure for thousands of websites.
>
> TL;DR: Open source isn’t broken. But the way we fund it often is. Let’s talk about what actually works.
>
> In this episode, we sit down with Zach Leatherman, creator of Eleventy (11ty), to talk honestly about what happens after open source succeeds. From nap-time coding and nights-and-weekends maintenance to venture capital pressure, burnout risk, and the reality of funding long-lived developer tools, this conversation digs into the cultural and financial tradeoffs behind modern open source.
>
> We cover sustainability, community expectations, funding models that don’t rely on hockey-stick growth, and why “free forever” only works if the people behind the project can stay whole humans.
