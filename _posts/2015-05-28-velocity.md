My [beautiful daughter](https://instagram.com/p/2MpabyP3h9/) was born exactly 26 days before the Velocity Conference. The other parents in my life warned me what having a new child would be like—you live your life in one hour increments between feedings, twenty four hours a day. I did not heed their warnings and used many of those sleep-deprived increments to make a brand new presentation on Web Fonts for Velocity.

## Thank You

A huge thanks to [Steve Souders](https://twitter.com/souders) for goading me into submitting a proposal to the conference—I had a great time. It was amazing to finally meet Steve in person as well as [Katie Kovalcin](https://twitter.com/katiekovalcin) and [Bruce Lawson](https://twitter.com/brucel), people I had only known previously through the magic of the Internet.
