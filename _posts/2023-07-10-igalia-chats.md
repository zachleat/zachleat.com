The timing of this chat was _interesting_, as Brian notes at the very bottom of the post:

> Just a closing note that in between the recording and release of this chat, the situation for 11ty changed again, as Zach announced he'd taken a new job with CloudCannon as a developer advocate, which would include paid development and support time for the project! Congratulations to CloudCannon.

You can see the [CloudCannon announcement](/web/cloudcannon/) posted two weeks after the recording of this podcast.
