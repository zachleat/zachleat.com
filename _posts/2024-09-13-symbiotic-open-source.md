_I‚Äôve been laid off twice_ in the past year and a half trying to navigate my professional career through the moderate success that has followed 11ty. I don‚Äôt feel as though I‚Äôve been particularly successful at it, to be frank. What I _have_ felt is largely expendable.

I don‚Äôt blame any companies or individuals for those feelings‚Äîfor me it‚Äôs representative of a larger problem with the incentives of open source software. This is further complicated by the influence of temporary and unsustainable ideas of ‚Äúfree‚Äù influenced by venture capital, but I digress.

In seven years, the 11ty project has undergone various levels of funding:

1. After-hours side-project
1. Full time employment-sponsored by one company
1. Part time sponsored by one company
1. [Independently full-time community-funded](/web/independent-sustainable-11ty/)

Each of this had their benefits and drawbacks; each a unique reflection of the companies that I was coupled to at the time (and most importantly: the economic environment of the funding of these companies).

## Boundaries

Independent of funding, the raw truth about open source software development is that it can be very parasitic if you don‚Äôt set boundaries.

1. Developers may place demands on your time in ways that are unhealthy and one-sided.
1. Companies (even those with _trillion dollar market caps_) may use your software without investing appropriately into it (via developer resources or direct monetary contributions)‚Ä¶ and may also have expectations that are unhealthy and one-sided.

It can be quite tempting to shirk the guardrails of healthy boundaries to pursue growth. Growth can unlock a lot of second-order things: power, influence, and _sometimes_ money _(here be dragons)_.

Regardless, the single throughline that is consistent for all four types of financial situationships I‚Äôve been in is this: **the further your job is from the direct bottom line and business needs of the company that you work for, the more expendable you are.**

## Truths

Eleventy received an overwhelming amount of support from individuals that believe in the project and for that I am so grateful. At time of writing the Open Collective has had `668` different financial contributors. Some comparisons gathered from Open Collective (in ascending order): Astro has `106` contributors, Solid `124`, Jekyll `148`, Preact `234`, Svelte `497`, Nuxt `530`, and Vue `805`.

But given the scale of these contributions, Eleventy wasn‚Äôt quite _popular enough_ to pay one full-time staff/lead developer salary via our Open Collective contributions alone. If I were just starting my career fresh out of college (I‚Äôm not), this would have been an easier hurdle to clear.

Our sustainability fundraising goal reflected and included this truth ($6k recurring per month) and I understood that I would have to supplement with some kind of paid offering before the runway dried up: whether that was a SaaS product, Pro-tier, Paid support, or Consulting.

That‚Äôs when the fine folks at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) dropped in with an exciting opportunity that I believe will be a win-win for everyone (and **not a repeat of the financially decoupled business models** we‚Äôve tried before): [11ty (the project) is joining Font Awesome (the company)](/web/eleventy-font-awesome/).

The game plan hasn‚Äôt changed‚Äîit‚Äôs been upgraded with the stability (and mentorship) of a well-established software business moving forward.

## Next Steps

Again, to be very clear **we‚Äôll continue to develop and maintain the Eleventy open source project as before.** I‚Äôm super excited and feel very lucky to get up every morning to work on Eleventy‚Äîwhich I think is a very rare feeling seven years into any software project.

I‚Äôve updated all of the blog posts to reflect that we‚Äôre winding down our [sustainability fundraising campaign](/web/independent-sustainable-11ty/). If you would like to wind down your personal individual recurring contributions‚Äîplease feel free to do so. Do note that any existing and future Open Collective funds collected _will continue to be spent to fund open source work for 11ty_.

As always, if you have questions (even difficult or awkward questions)‚Äîplease hit me up on [Mastodon](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat) (or any [other](/about/) social media that I check less frequently üòÖ).
