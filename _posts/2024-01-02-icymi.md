2023 has been one hell-for-leather roller coaster of a year.

## Down for the count

In late April, Eleventy [lost its full time sponsorship](/web/eleventy-side-project/) in the midst of Netlify‚Äôs struggle to survive the gauntlet of late-stage venture capitalism.

I burned out pretty hard during this transition. We could go back and forth about the details of how it was handled but as things move forward it doesn‚Äôt seem productive to rehash it _(I wrote and deleted this section many times)_. The most productive summary I can offer is that the Silicon Valley mentality of hockey-stick hyper-growth (or death) is simultaneously unhealthy, needlessly destructive, and unfortunately pervasive.

I do feel a bit of shame in admitting to myself that despite all of the precautions I took while administering Eleventy as an independent project, Eleventy almost died this year‚Äîand the responsibility for that is mine.

## Don‚Äôt call it a comeback

In happier news, in August I [joined CloudCannon as a developer advocate](/web/cloudcannon/) and they are donating **part** of my time to Eleventy‚Äôs development. Coupled with their four-day work week üèÜüèÜüèÜ, I‚Äôve been using a majority of Fridays for Eleventy development too (per my discretion).

CloudCannon are incredibly supportive of the project and Eleventy certainly _would not_ have rebounded as quickly as it did without their help.

Importantly, CloudCannon‚Äôs healthier work-life balance and subsequent mental shift rebalanced my perspective of Eleventy away from something that _needed to compete to survive_ to a much healthier and enjoyable place.

## Eleventy in 2023

Eleventy still had a pretty great year despite our setbacks.

*  We had 2.9 million downloads in 2023 _(+34.36% year over year)_.
* We crossed cumulative download milestones for [6 million](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/six-million/) and [7 million](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/seven-million/) and we‚Äôre eyeing 8 million soon!
* We shipped [stable v2.0](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/) üèÜ
* We looked to refocus the project with [Project Slipstream](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/pull/3074) and published our first [Community Survey](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/community-survey/) to get help prioritizing those goals (with [results](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/community-survey-results/))
* We have shipped a few [v3.0 alpha releases](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/canary-eleventy-v3/) with support for ESM and asynchronous configuration.

And that‚Äôs not all: we have a few surprises in the hopper planned for 2024 that I‚Äôm very excited about.

## Thank You Notes

I have a lot to be thankful for in 2023 and my family goes at the top of that list. I had so many long lunchtime talks with my wife as we navigated through this year. She has been incredibly patient as she sits on the receiving end of privileged-dude-with-a-podcast-microphone levels of venting about tech drama.

A big thank you to new [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) friends [George Phillips](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgepaulphillips/), [Liam Bigelow](https://github.com/bglw/), [Mike Neumegen](https://mikeneumegen.com/), [Olivia Nicholson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-nicholson-42a050127/), [David Large](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-large-4875b81b2/) _(and others)_.
