title: The <del>Space-Time</del> Progressive Enhancement Continuum
draft: true
---
For a very long time, many folks involved in creating and standardizing new features for the standards didn’t (and perhaps still don’t) understand progressive enhancement. And worse, folks with a cursory understanding of it may not see the _value_ in it.

I won’t mince words: I believe that progressive enhancement is the single most important user-friendly practice that elevates web development above all other forms of computer programming.

- The harshest development environment quote
- How the web _rarely_ removes features, we’re all on the same version/runtime: HTML 1.0 still supported
- `@layers`
- `accent-color` and Baseline
- ubiquitous versus progressive (adoption rates)
- ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
- `script type="module"` and `nomodule` (decorators/JSX)
