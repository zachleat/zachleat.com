The Eleventy API ecosystem is growing. It started with [a screenshot service](/web/screenshots/). Now, we have a very simple service to generate SVG images for sparklines. This is using the [`sparkline-svg` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sparkline-svg) from [{% twitterImageAvatar "CharlesStover" %}CharlesStover](https://twitter.com/CharlesStover).

<div class="primarylink"><a href="https://github.com/11ty/api-sparkline">https://github.com/11ty/api-sparkline</a></div>

My version is running on `https://v1.sparkline.11ty.dev/` using the same versioning via [Netlify Branch Subdomains](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/multiple-domains/#branch-subdomains) strategy as the screenshot service.

URLs support the following formats:

```
/[height]x[width]/[values]/
/[height]x[width]/[values]/[color]/
```

You can also view this on the sidebar of this very website (at larger viewport sizes).

## Generating the values from an Eleventy collection

```js
eleventyConfig.addLiquidFilter("getYearlyPostCountList", (posts, startYear = 2007) => {
  let years = [];
  for(let year = startYear; year <= (new Date).getFullYear(); year++) {
    let count = posts.filter(function(post) {
      return post.data.page.date.getFullYear() === parseInt(year, 10);
    }).length;

    years.push(count);
  }
  return years.join(",");
});
```
