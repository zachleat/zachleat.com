* [Best-in-class Image Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) supports first-class SVG and AVIF, works with `<img>`, `<picture>`, or even in your `CSS` (e.g. `background-image`).
* [Serverless Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/):
  - Render dynamic pages with Progressive Enhancement
  - Use [Distributed Persistent Rendering](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/14/faster-builds-for-large-sites-on-netlify-with-on-demand-builders-now-in-early-access/) to render and cache the first request

  - Data can be fetched at run time (e.g. [for live CMS previews](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1405650895665254406)) or [build time (for maximum speed)](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/#re-use-build-time-cache-from-the-cache-assets-plugin)
