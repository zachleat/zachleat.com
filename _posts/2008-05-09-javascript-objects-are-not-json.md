title: Javascript Objects are NOT JSON
---

*The headline should more accurately read “Javascript Objects are not **necessarily** JSON.” But that waters it down a bit, don’t you think?*

I know this has been posted a few times before, but this is not something I knew until recently, and after learning it, have noticed quite a few other people doing it wrong as well. So, to risk adding another reverb to the echo chamber, I’ll post a link to a [good explanation][1] by Jesse Skinner on the specifics of the JSON specification.

The main point here is that **all object keys and strings in JSON must have double quotes.** I encourage you to look through the [train track specification][2] to verify for yourself.

If you try to use Captain [Crockford’s JSON Parser][3], it won’t parse your string with single quotes or (un/single)-quoted object keys. His parser has a nice regex checker built-in (and a walker callback to let you parse date strings into Date() objects). It’s a good way to verify that external data, or a data source not under your control, is safe to eval and use in your own code.

Here are a few quick examples:

## Valid JSON

```js
{"myKey": "myString"}
```

Don’t use single quotes. Don’t use unquoted object keys.

## Invalid JSON

```js
{myKey: "myString"}
{'myKey': 'myString'}
```
