I’ve been a full-time professional web developer for 17 years. In that time, [I’ve seen things](https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/923571836062982144/).

I remember when web browser _developer tools_ were first introduced, using Firebug for the first time.

I predate even the WebKit mobile revolution: a time when proxy browsers reigned supreme and Blackberry was king.

I bore witness to the React schism, ruthlessly popularizing Single Page Apps and [clientside rendering](https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1341117427845914630/); giving rise to a [slower web](https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/) in the name of developer experience.

I embraced the npm revolution.

I rode the waves of Node.js.

I webpacked across [The Great Divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/).

## The Great Divide

The Great Divide really resonated with me. I keep coming back to it and I do think it continues to accurately describe what feels like two very distinct and separate camps of web developer.

The question I keep asking though: is the divide borne from a healthy specialization of skills or a symptom of unnecessary tooling complexity?

I ran a [JavaScript meetup for six years (2012-2018)](https://www.zachleat.com/web/passing-the-nebraskajs-baton/) and a [JavaScript conference for five years (2015-2019)](https://www.zachleat.com/web/nejsconf/final/). I maintain [Eleventy, a JavaScript Open Source project](https://www.11ty.dev/). But **I would never identify as being on the JavaScript side of The Great Divide**.

Folks that know me from my time at [Filament Group](https://www.filamentgroup.com/) and my work with web fonts would likely place me on the User Experience side of the divide. I feel more at home there.

But I also vehemently reject that I have to exclusively choose one side, and perhaps that is best reflected in my work on Eleventy.

## Mirror, Mirror

The disconnect manifests itself time and again as accepted truths in the JavaScript community to me feel like anything but. I was reminded of that again today when I visited the [2022 State of JavaScript results](https://2022.stateofjs.com/).

Well, wait. When you’re straddling the divide, you pretty clearly recognize that [React](https://webcomponents.dev/blog/all-the-ways-to-make-a-web-component/#bundle-size) [never](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/) [had](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/javascript-framework-todomvc-size-comparison-504f) [all of the](https://aerotwist.com/blog/when-everything-is-important-nothing-is/) [answers](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/mv-initial-load-times.html).

Well, wait. When you straddle the divide, you know that [Remix](https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1534588439580090368/) (67.7 kB compressed) and [Next.js](https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1584995586918731776/) (90 kB compressed) have not meaningfully reduced their bundle sizes at all. Measurement reveals that bundles are growing: Next.js was [72.2 kB compressed in 2021](https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1468419834501337088).

## The Great Dissonance

This JavaScript community (if judged by the demographics of this survey) seems to be comprised mostly of folks that are largely building with [React, webpack, and Jest](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/#scatterplot_overview). With [React on 3.2% of web sites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/comparison/js-jquery,js-react) and jQuery at 77.7% (as of January 2023), that’s a pretty small slice of a much larger community.

We seem to live in different worlds.

I want to be a **web developer**, not a JavaScript developer.

If you live in a different world too, [we should be friends](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat).
