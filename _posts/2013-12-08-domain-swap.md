> When in the Course of ~~human~~ DOM events it becomes necessary for one ~~people~~ developer to dissolve the ~~political bands~~ DNS bindings which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of ~~Nature~~ Moore and of ~~Nature's~~ Source Codeâ€™s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of ~~man~~developerkind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

In a normal development workflow your code can move through multiple development environments. Sometimes a coworker emails you a URL to a dev server but you want to check the same path on your local environment. Or maybe you want to more easily switch between your test servers and production.

We must declare our independence from the shackles of our development domains! For far too long have they taxed us.

[Domain Swap](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/domain-swap/ngiiihlebepigjbefembddhdplmaghep/) is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to easily toggle between and manage different sets of domains. It was created by the inimitable [John Hobbs](https://twitter.com/jmhobbs) with minor contributions from myself and [Matt Steele](https://twitter.com/mattdsteele).

It is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmhobbs/domain-swap).
