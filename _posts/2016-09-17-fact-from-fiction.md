I did a talk at Barcamp Omaha on September 17, 2016 about how to find verifiable trustworthy information on the web. I didn’t publish it online because it contained some jokes about people that think the Earth isn’t sphere-ish and those people started crashing my Twitter mentions. I decided not to give them any more attention.

Guess you had to be there! Sorry!
