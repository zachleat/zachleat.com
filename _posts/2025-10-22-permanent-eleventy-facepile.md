title: Permanent Facepile Credit to Individuals Supporting Eleventy
tags: eleventy
---
Every single page of the 11ty.dev Docs has a [facepile in the footer](https://www.11ty.dev/#gold-sponsors), populated (automatically) by our [Open Collective supporters list](https://opencollective.com/11ty). Historically, to be a part of this facepile you needed to meet the following criteria:

1. Have an _active_ recurring (monthly/yearly) Open Collective contribution (of any amount).
2. Have a non-default avatar or a web site added to your Open Collective profile that [we can pull a favicon from](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/services/indieweb-avatar/).

Gold and silver tiers are shuffled randomly at build time but the Supporter tier is sorted by cumulative donation amount (descending).

Moving forward, the Gold and Silver tiers will still require _active_ contributions but weâ€™re relaxing the Supporter tier to be more inclusive of emeritus/former supporters:

1. Individuals contributing no longer need to be _active_ and will be shown if cumulative contributions are greater than USD $55. This change means that one-time/non-recurring contributors will now be shown (if the amount meets stated minimums).
	- Organization accounts will still need to have an _active_ contribution to be shown. _(Individual versus organization refers to the [type of Open Collective account](https://documentation.opencollective.com/getting-started/creating-an-organization) making the contribution)_
2. If you have the default avatar (and no web site in your Open Collective profile), the minimum cumulative total is USD $200. Too many folks donâ€™t have an avatar or web site ðŸ˜… (which makes the facepile lookâ€¦Â well, not great): if you add an avatar or web site weâ€™ll update with your changes! The build runs (at minimum) daily.
3. Notably, itâ€™s unchanged that there are no minimums for _active_ recurring monthly/yearly contributions (for both individuals and organizations).

I hope this relaxation gives proper _permanent_ credit to individuals that have contributed monetarily to the project, while filtering out the spam/bot accounts that have contributed a few dollars and subsequently immediately cancelled (hoping to be listed on the web site).

_While I have yâ€™all here I might also mention that your avatar links directly to the web site listed in your Open Collective profile. While these links do [use `rel="sponsored"`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/qualify-outbound-links), it can help your search engine rank so it helps to configure your Open Collective profile appropriately!_

Appreciate yâ€™all!
