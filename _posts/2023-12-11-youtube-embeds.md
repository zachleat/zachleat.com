The default YouTube embed is… well… atrocious (sorry). Consider an embed for this [sample video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYJpFdEaAuc):

* `1149 kB` total weight, including:
* `971 kB` JavaScript
* `61 kB` Poster Image (jpeg, 1280×720)
* `48 kB` CSS
* `41 kB` of iframed HTML
* `28 kB` for ×3 Roboto Web Fonts

_(compressed wire weights reported)_

This, uh, conspicuously—does not include any video content.

Instead of the above, I typically use [Paul Irish’s `lite-youtube` web component](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) for better YouTube embeds on my site. The benefit here is that if a user does not play the video, they don’t have to pay the bandwidth overhead.

This component weighs in:

* `31 kB` total weight, including:
* `6 kB` JavaScript
* `3 kB` CSS
* `22 kB` Poster Image

**This is a huge improvement: a reduction of 1149 kB to 31 kB.**

## Higher quality posters

`<lite-youtube>` does provide an _eagerly loaded_ JavaScript-only 480×360 poster `background-image` for you (usually ~20–30kB). This behavior is skipped if you’ve added your own `background-image` in a `style` attribute on the tag.

This works fine but I wanted my poster images to be a bit higher quality and I used the 11ty [OpenGraph API](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/services/opengraph/) to easily accomplish this. I pointed the `background-image` property to the API and required a JPEG format in the output, which seemed to average about 80–100kB each, instead (and didn’t require JavaScript).

```html
<lite-youtube
	videoid="YYJpFdEaAuc"
	style="
		background-image: url('https://v1.opengraph.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYYJpFdEaAuc/auto/jpeg/');
	">
	…
</lite-youtube>
```

### One Weird Trick to Lazy Load the Poster

These components were being managed by [`<is-land>` for lazy initialization](https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com/blob/80c605c0654ff509a996d5dbbef7c142fae01f7b/_components/youtube-lite-player.webc) and despite the components being lazily initialized the poster images were still being eagerly loaded (_before_ the is-lands were initialized).

Here’s how I fixed it:

```css
is-land[ready] lite-youtube {
	--yt-poster-img-url: var(--yt-poster-img-url-lazy);
}
```

We are using a double custom property method to work with the existing feature of `background-image` overrides in `lite-youtube`:

```html
<lite-youtube
	videoid="YYJpFdEaAuc"
	style="
		--yt-poster-img-url-lazy: url('https://v1.opengraph.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYYJpFdEaAuc/auto/jpeg/');
		background-image: var(--yt-poster-img-url);
	">
	…
</lite-youtube>
```

As this is using `<is-land>` this re-enables the JavaScript dependency for the poster images but I’m okay with that, as I also include a text link to YouTube for each video embed (as part of the [WebC component](https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com/blob/80c605c0654ff509a996d5dbbef7c142fae01f7b/_components/youtube-lite-player.webc)).

You can see all of this in action below:
