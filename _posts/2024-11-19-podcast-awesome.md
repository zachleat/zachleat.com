> Ready to geek out? In this episode of Podcast Awesome's Nerd Show and Tell, Matt sits down with none other than Zach Leatherman, the tech dynamo and creator behind Eleventy — the static site generator that’s got web devs buzzing. Zach’s tech-world experience is a wild ride of innovation, grit, and love for the open web. With a little help from our team here at Font Awesome, Zach’s pushing to make open-source sustainable and bring back the glory days of personal websites, free from algorithm overlords.

> Zach gets real about the rollercoaster ride of building Eleventy and why owning your corner of the internet is more important than ever. Expect some hot takes on the tech industry, social media, and how platforms like Eleventy could just be the ticket to a new wave of web independence. Plus, you’ll get a peek into the collaborative brainpower with our founders Dave and Travis backing Zach’s mission. Hold onto your icons — this one’s packed!
