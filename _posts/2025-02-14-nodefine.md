title: '?nodefine — a pattern to skip Custom Element definitions'
---
The following code is a minimum viable custom element:

```js
class Nimble extends HTMLElement {}

customElements.define("nim-ble", Nimble);
```

The `define` call is typically packaged up in the component code (for ease of use) and not in your application code. I typically adapt this into a static function like so:

```js
class Nimble extends HTMLElement {
  static define(tagName) {
    customElements.define(tagName || "nim-ble", this);
  }
}

Nimble.define();
```

On first glance, this might not offer much benefit, but depending on the platform features I’m using I may also include a [Cut-the-Mustard style feature test](https://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard) in there:

```js
class Nimble extends HTMLElement {
  static define(tagName) {
		// Baseline 2020: Chrome 71 Safari 12.1 Firefox 65
		// (extended browser support on top of ESM and Custom Elements)
		if(typeof globalThis !== "undefined") {
			customElements.define(tagName || "nim-ble", this);
		}
  }
}

Nimble.define();
```

## Automatic Definition

The biggest drawback I’m struggling with in these patterns is how to allow folks to opt-out of the `customElements.define` call when they import or bundle the script. Perhaps they might want to use a different tag name (you can only define a `class` once in the registry), or run some additional advanced configuration before definition.

Here’s how you would typically import the script code (or `import "./nimble.js"` works too):

```html
<!-- <nim-ble> is defined for you -->
<script type="module" src="nimble.js"></script>
```

Here’s a new idea I’m experimenting with to allow opt-out of `define()` by adding a `?nodefine` query parameter to the script URL:

```html
<!-- <nim-ble> is *not* defined for you -->
<script type="module" src="nimble.js?nodefine"></script>
<script type="module">
Nimble.define("some-other-name");
</script>
```

And then in your component code you’ll check for `?nodefine` before auto defining the custom element:

```js
class Nimble extends HTMLElement {
  static define(tagName) {
    customElements.define(tagName || "nim-ble", this);
  }
}

// This line is the magic:
if(!(new URL(import.meta.url)).searchParams.has("nodefine")) {
  Nimble.define();
}

window.Nimble = Nimble;
export { Nimble };
```

This pattern works with `import` too:

```html
<script type="module">
// <nim-ble> is *not* defined for you
import { Nimble } from "./nimble.js?nodefine";

Nimble.define("some-other-name");

// Or directly:
customElements.define("nim-ble", Nimble);
</script>
```

This would also work on any Custom Element code adopting this pattern nestled inside a larger bundle:

```html
<script type="module" src="bundle-398720.js?nodefine"></script>
```

What do y’all think?
