Over the weekend I was finishing up some polish on the slides of my most recent conference talk when my daughter walked in to my office. We decided to record a short video of that interaction and put it up on Twitter.

Needless to say, [the tweet](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1365786974813093896)â€”uhâ€”went much further than I expected.

If youâ€™re at all curious how we did it, Iâ€™ll explain it and more in this talk about building web sites. The talk also delves into Single Page Applications, Multi Page Applications, modern JavaScript Frameworks, and what I believe to be a better future for web development.
