I’m excited to let you guys know that my first [Filament Group][1] open source project was released. I made the move to Filament to both allow more client/open-source crossover work and to collaborate with some great Front End Engineers. *SocialCount* is the first public evidence of that goal.

> SocialCount is a small jQuery plugin for progressively enhanced, lazy loaded, mobile friendly social networking widgets.

Third party JavaScript is one of the biggest challenges we face in our quest for high performance web sites and hopefully SocialCount will help tame the slothful beast.

Astute readers may recognize SocialCount from the implementation on [A Front End Engineer’s Manifesto][2] (page 2 and the footer).
