After a stream with [Ben Myers a few weeks back in which we built a color contrast checker using Eleventy Serverless](/web/some-antics-eleventy-serverless/) (and to prepare for an [upcoming talk at the Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/hello-world/)), I wanted another crack at the use case: to build a site with individually addressable URLs for every color. It’s an awesome demo—a huge sample space that’s not feasible for build-time generation. Even if you limited the space to hex color formats only (without transparency), that’d be 16 million colors and 16 million pages.

> …there are 24 bits used to specify a web color within the sRGB gamut, and 16,777,216 colors that may be so specified.—[Web colors, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#:~:text=there%20are%2024%20bits%20used%20to%20specify%20a%20web%20color%20within%20the%20sRGB%20gamut%2C%20and%2016%2C777%2C216%20colors%20that%20may%20be%20so%20specified.)

Eleventy Serverless is well suited for this use case, it can accept wildcard slugs via the URL and generates pages based on that input at run-time instead of build time:

```yaml
---
permalink:
  serverless: "/:color/"
---
```

Without further ado, here’s where the project (code named [Rainglow](https://rainglow.zachleat.dev/)) landed:

### Implementation

* This demo is using [Distributed Persistent Rendering](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/isr-dpr-explained/) via Netlify On-demand Builders to generate and render each individual color page at most **once per deploy**. This saves a bunch-o-serverless-function-calls to help you stay in the free tier on Netlify Functions _and_ improves the performance of the second visitor to each page. You can see where this is enabled in [`netlify/functions/serverless/index.js`](https://github.com/zachleat/rainglow/blob/635fef6af6f9c4f97a5516c6bf824dfd24f6cb27/netlify/functions/serverless/index.js#L43).
* Everything runs through one Eleventy Markdown template [`rainglow.md`](https://github.com/zachleat/rainglow/blob/main/rainglow.md) and one [Eleventy Layout file](https://github.com/zachleat/rainglow/blob/main/_includes/layout.njk).
* The background color, foreground color, and gradient are **calculated using Computed Data** in [`_data/eleventyComputed.js`](https://github.com/zachleat/rainglow/blob/main/_data/eleventyComputed.js)
  * The foreground color is calculated by choosing whether or not black or white has a **better contrast ratio** with the background.
  * A [`<meta name="theme-color">` is added with the background color](https://css-tricks.com/meta-theme-color-and-trickery/).
* The [config file has two filters and a shortcode](https://github.com/zachleat/rainglow/blob/main/.eleventy.js).
  * The bulk of the work here is done by [the `tinycolor2` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinycolor2).
  * The color for the `Random color` link is provided via [the `random` function in the `tinycolor2` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinycolor2#random).
