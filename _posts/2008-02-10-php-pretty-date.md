This class is pretty much a direct port of [John Resig’s JavaScript Pretty Date][1] to PHP 5. A few notes:

 [1]: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-pretty-date/

*   Requires PHP >= 5.10, due to the usage of PHP’s new [DateTime][2]class.
*   The new DateTime object parses strings using PHP’s [strtotime][3], so you don’t need to pass in an ISO8601 formatted date, as in JavaScript Pretty Date. Try “now”, or “next Wednesday”, or “ 2 weeks 4 days 23 hours 9 seconds”.
*   Extended to handle Months and Years in the past (JavaScript version only goes to weeks)

 [3]: http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php

Usage:

    // pass in a String DateTime, compared to another String DateTime (defaults to now)
    $myString = Date_Difference::getStringResolved('-7 weeks');
    $myString = Date_Difference::getStringResolved('-7 weeks', '+1 week');

    // pass in a DateTime object, compared to another DateTime object (defaults to now)
    // useful with the Propel ORM, which uses DateTime objects internally.
    $myString = Date_Difference::getString(new DateTime('-7 weeks'));
    $myString = Date_Difference::getString(new DateTime('-7 weeks'), new DateTime('+1 week'));
