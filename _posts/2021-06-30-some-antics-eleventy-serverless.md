[{% imgavatar "BenDMyers" %}Ben Myers](https://twitter.com/BenDMyers) was super gracious to invite me on his stream to go through a first experience with Eleventy Serverless! We ran into a few snags on the episode and it was really great early feedback for things I can improve both in the code and in the docs for the stable release. Later, Ben published the stream on YouTube.
