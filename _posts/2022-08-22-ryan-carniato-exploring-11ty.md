> Static Site Generation is actually a topic I know nothing about. In all my years I'm yet to use one. Luckily we have Zach with us to show us the ropes, and to showcase his project 11ty, a JavaScript-based static site generator. Join us as I learn the ins and outs of a whole world that lives within the build step.
