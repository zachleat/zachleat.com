> Next to coming up with project names, managing tables in a responsive layout is one of the trickiest problems in web development. Semantically structured tables are notoriously difficult to style as anything other than… well… a table. On the other hand, cobbling together a pile of `div`s and `span`s into a table-like shape means giving up the semantic meaning, accessibility, and navigability of real `table` elements to represent tabular data, or it means jumping through hoops to recreate those features.  When it comes down to it, the semantic benefits of real `table` elements make them our first and best choice.
