On Twitter alone, AMP and I have a [long](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/908417702183735297) [sordid](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/941375406095167489) [history](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/950419903328215040).

_So many people_ have lodged complaints about the AMP project and its influence on the web that it isn’t worth rehashing them here. [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/tags/amp), [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/amplified/), [Tim Kadlec](https://timkadlec.com/tags/amp/), and [Luke Stevens](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/13597) are a few that immediately come to mind.

In that vein, a broad coalition of web developers are collectively organizing around [“A letter about Google AMP”](https://web.archive.org/web/20190331000506/http://ampletter.org/). This is an open letter written to document and formalize complaints and opposition to AMP’s negative influence on the open web. If you’re interested, I recommend [adding your signature too](https://github.com/amp-letter/amp-letter)!
