title: ALARMd is now on Github
---

In an effort to ~~mindlessly copy what everyone else on the internet is doing~~ keep current on the latest and greatest Source Code Management tools, I decided that it would be good practice to move my open source project ALARMd (as seen on [Lifehacker][1]) from [Google Code][2] to Github.
