The humble component. The building block of modern web development.

```jsx
// MyButton.jsx
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}

// Usage
<MyButton/>
```

You may recognize the above example taken from the documentation of one of the most popular component libraries in use today‚Äî[{% indieAvatar "https://vercel.com/" %}vercel.js](https://react.dev/).

Folks may not know that the web platform has _some_ component functionality built-in and is evolving support for new component development standards and specifications moving forward! These features are broadly known as Web Components.

Aside from vercel.js, there are a variety of other popular component libraries too (of varying degree of web component friendliness):

## Web Components are already a Success Story

Despite some notable criticism, web components are already widely used across the web.

In August 2023, [Chrome Platform Status](https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/1689) reports that 19.4% of page loads in Google Chrome were using a web component (via the `CustomElementRegistryDefine` key). For comparison `<img loading>` was at 15% and CSS Grid at 20%.

You can check out more social proof on: [_Are Web Components A Thing Yet?_](https://arewebcomponentsathingyet.com/)

They are particularly popular in large enterprise design system implementations:

{% slides slides.dir, "19-26", slides.alt %}

Many of the component libraries listed above (even those written by authors that have criticized web components) have an export-to-web-component feature built-in.

## But‚Äîwhat are they?

Web Components is an umbrella term that encompasses many web platform technologies and we‚Äôll go over a couple of the big (and in my opinion, most relevant) ones.

### Custom Elements

{% slides slides.dir, "35-49", slides.alt %}

Custom Elements allow you to attach a JavaScript `class` to any custom element you define on your page, to add behaviors and JavaScript-generated content üò± to the respective element instances on the page. These are automatically initialized for you for the full lifecycle of the page (for both server-rendered, JavaScript-generated, or content injected via `fetch()`).

1. Custom elements must not be void elements (like `<img>` or `<meta>`), they must have a start and end tag.
2. Custom elements must have a dash in the tag name, so as to not conflict with future additions to the web platform.

{% slides slides.dir, "61", slides.alt %}

If you use populate these with your own server-rendered nested HTML (also known as the default slot/Light DOM/plain ‚Äôol HTML) and use Custom Elements to for behavior-only additions (and not modify rendered DOM), you can even avoid layout shift!

Some folks have started referring to this approach as creating [HTML Web Components](/web/a-taxonomy-of-web-component-types/#html-web-components) (see post for examples).

_If your expectation is full stack component-driven development_, you will quickly encounter a developer experience problem here when authoring components in this way. Multiple instances of the same component need to repeat the same nested content and any changes to nested content need to be applied manually to all instances. You end up writing this:

```html
<my-counter><button>1</button></my-counter>
<my-counter><button>2</button></my-counter>
<my-counter><button>3</button></my-counter>
```

When we want to author this (and have it server-render as the above):

```html
<my-counter>1</my-counter>
<my-counter>2</my-counter>
<my-counter>3</my-counter>
```

### Shadow DOM

{% slides slides.dir, "68-85", slides.alt %}

Shadow DOM is the next level of our web components evolution. It solves the developer experience problem with repetition in authoring markup at the expense of clientside rendering üò≠.

This trade-off introduces additional complexities around managing layout shift and the flash of unstyled content (FOUC). Typical approaches to solve these problems either put all of the JavaScript into the critical rendering path (üëéüèª no thank you) and/or hide the components until they‚Äôre defined via JavaScript (also üëéüèª no thank you).

One such approach to have control over pre-definition and post-definition styling is to use [`:defined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:defined). It‚Äôs a _very useful_ tool for styling and progressive enhancement (occupying some of the same architectural vibes as the [`scripting` media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/scripting)), but in Shadow DOM heavy component libraries it is often applied to hide components pre-definition (üëéüèª no thank you).

{% slides slides.dir, "86-92", slides.alt %}

### Declarative Shadow DOM

{% slides slides.dir, "94-108", slides.alt %}

How the pendulum swings! As we evolve to our next level of web components, we‚Äôre adding Declarative Shadow DOM. This allows you to put your Shadow DOM template in nested markup inside of each element instance.

This solves the clientside rendering dependency for Shadow DOM but at the expense of repetition in authoring markup! The ol‚Äô switcheroo feels like a de-evolution back to the approach we discussed in Custom Elements!

One unique benefit this approach does provide is that it allows you to use scoped CSS inside of the component without a JavaScript dependency. Non-declarative (imperative) JavaScript Shadow DOM offers scoped CSS too but for me this repeats some of the mistakes made by CSS-in-JS approaches and introduces a runtime JavaScript dependency on styling.

```html
<my-counter>
  <template shadowrootmode="open">
    <style>
    * { color: blue; }
    </style>
    <button><slot></slot></button>
  </template>
</my-counter>
```

Again, the repetition of these templates in every component instance is tedious and brittle.

We can see the tension between authoring repetition and server-side rendering, right? (Non-declarative) Shadow DOM was the only approach so far that offered a good authoring experience without repetition, but required clientside rendering.

## Server-side Rendering

If we could have a reusable Declarative Shadow DOM template that did not require nesting, that would be pretty ideal, right? _(Some discussion happening in [this WICG issue](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/1009))_

I would love something like this (though I acknowledge the likely issues with streaming here):

```html
<!-- ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS CODE IS ASPIRATIONAL -->
<!-- ‚ö†Ô∏è IT DOESN‚ÄôT WORK ANYWHERE -->
<template definition="my-counter">
  <style>
  button {}
  </style>
  <button><slot></slot></button>
</template>

<my-counter>1</my-counter>
<my-counter>2</my-counter>
<my-counter>3</my-counter>
```

This is why folks claim that server-side rendering is yet to be a solved problem‚Äîbecause it has not yet been solved at the web platform level. I‚Äôd also wager that this is the biggest complaint about web components, too. Folks expect this to be solved because this is a problem that many component libraries have solved. However, I would warn that we‚Äôre holding these two disparate things to different expectations.

Clientside component frameworks _can_ be compared to web component specifications and tools (though in fairness, some overlap exists). But if your component framework introduces an additional server rendering step or abstraction, it seems unfair to compare that to clientside-only web components.

Server-rendered Svelte or React should not be compared to Custom Elements or Shadow DOM‚Äîthese are apples and oranges. Client rendered Svelte and React‚Äîfine, sure‚Äîbut not server-rendered versions of these.

For me these criticisms suggest that we need an additional server-rendered abstraction for web components, too.

## Framework Tension

{% slides slides.dir, "128-133", slides.alt %}

JavaScript Frameworks and Web Components can work together‚Äîthough some are more web component friendly than others.

In some respects it feels like the web platform chased the early clientside rendered, single page application (SPA) architectural vibes of React, Ember, Angular, and others. The more nimble frameworks have pivoted away from those mistakes. The platform will always be a bit behind but can offer more long term performance and maintenance potential.

* If you want to go all-in on Web Components, have a look at these answers to the server-rendered web component question:
	* [{% indieAvatar "https://lit.dev/" %}Lit](https://lit.dev/)

	* [{% indieAvatar "https://www.11ty.dev/" %}WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/)
* React has the worst [`custom-elements-everywhere.com`](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/) compatibility test score. If you‚Äôre deep in React-world, look at using [{% indieAvatar "https://preactjs.com/" %}Preact](https://preactjs.com/) to provide a more future-friendly and compatible experience.
* Solid, Angular, Svelte, and Vue support web components as a compilation target too.

## A WebC Example

I built [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) so I guess I can now pivot this blog post to show you a small example of the rendered output you get when using it.

Consider a content template file `index.webc`:

```html
<my-counter>1</my-counter>
<my-counter>2</my-counter>
```

### Classical HTML

Next, we‚Äôll add a component definition for `my-counter` to `_components/my-counter.webc`:

```html
<style webc:scoped>
:host button {}
</style>
<button><slot></slot></button>
```

WebC will render `index.webc` as:

```html
<style>
  .wrfp4zhxg button {}
</style>

<my-counter class="wrfp4zhxg">
  <button>1</button>
</my-counter>
<my-counter class="wrfp4zhxg">
  <button>2</button>
</my-counter>
```

### Declarative Shadow DOM

You can also modify your component definition (`_components/my-counter.webc`) to use Declarative Shadow DOM, avoiding the issue of repeating your Shadow DOM template in your content:

```html
<template shadowrootmode="open">
  <style>
  button {}
  </style>
  <button><slot webc:raw></slot></button>
</template>
<slot></slot>
```

WebC will now server-render `index.webc` as:

```html
<my-counter>
  <template shadowrootmode="open">
    <style>
    button {}
    </style>
    <button><slot></slot></button>
  </template>
  1
</my-counter>

<my-counter>
  <template shadowrootmode="open">
    <style>
    button {}
    </style>
    <button><slot></slot></button>
  </template>
  2
</my-counter>
```

This server-applied abstraction offers a variety of benefits over earlier approaches:
