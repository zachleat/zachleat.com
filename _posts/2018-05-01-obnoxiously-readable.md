title: Obnoxiously Readable Responsive Text with Viewport Units

  - font-loading

Ever since I created [BigText](/web/bigtext-makes-text-big/) over _seven years_ ago, Iâ€™ve been a little bit obsessed with beautifully large text. Unfortunately my own blog had post titles that wereâ€”to be honestâ€”a little bland. I wanted to spice it up a bit and move from fixed text sizes to dynamic text that grows with the viewport size. Iâ€™ve seen many iterations of this approach using `resize` handlers in JavaScript:

* [BigText](/web/bigtext-makes-text-big/), which uses JavaScript to find the right text size automatically (itâ€™s a bit expensive and slow).
* [FitText.js](https://github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js) (from [Dave Rupert](https://github.com/davatron5000)) uses a developer-specified scaling factor to linearly scale the text size for you (fast but requires configuration).
    - [Non-jQuery version of FitText.js](https://github.com/adactio/FitText.js) from [Jeremy Keith](https://github.com/adactio)
* Another popular one is [FlowType.JS](http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/)â€”the concept is very similar.

There have been other incarnations of this style of JavaScript text resizing. But as far as I can tell, we had the option to retire all of these approaches when Viewport Units were well supported in 2012! _If CSS can do the job, do the job in CSS._ Delete your redundant JavaScripts, everyone!

I can already anticipate the first retort to post: the JavaScript plugins can resize to element size and not viewport size! Okayâ€”really this is just another vote for container queries. We can manage this with CSSâ€”it just requires additional, annoyingly attentive care to maintain code for the boundaries at which our text should be resizable and when it should be fixed. *But*â€”itâ€™s still better than a JavaScript resize-event handler (in my humble opinion). If we know where our components live in our layout, we can just adjust our Viewport Unit values accordingly to fake a sort of _Container Unit_.

## Example

The current layout specifications for my own blog post layout are:

* Baseline is 100% fluid width.
* Content has a `max-width: 589px` (`31em` at `font-size: 19px`) and maintains this `max-width` even when adding the right rail.

_(This layout specification reminds me of `sizes` from `srcset` with responsive images, hmmâ€¦)_

This is a pretty simple exampleâ€”we have two boundaries: the breakpoint at which weâ€™ll switch to using Viewport Units, and an upper bound when we hit the content `max-width` (at `589px`).


<div class="livedemo top" data-demo-label="Using Bounded font-size: 6.25vw">
    <style>
    #demo-1 {
        font-size: 20px;
        line-height: 1;
    }
    @media (min-width: 20em) { /* 320px */
        #demo-1 {
            font-size: 6.25vw;
        }
    }
    @media (min-width: 36.8125em) { /* 589px */
        #demo-1 {
            font-size: 36.8125px;
        }
    }
    </style>
    <div id="demo-1">This text only scales when the container width changes.</div>
</div>

You can customize breakpoints and minimum font-size to your use case:

``` css
#demo-1 {
    /* Minimum font-size */
    font-size: 20px;
}

/* Arbitrary minimum breakpoint */
/* Transition from 20px minimum font-size to vw using this formula: */
@media (min-width: 320px) {
    #demo-1 {
        /* ( Minimum font-size / Breakpoint ) âœ• 100 */
        /* ( 20px / 320px ) âœ• 100 = 6.25vw */
        font-size: 6.25vw;
    }
}

/* Content max-width breakpoint */
/* Transition from vw to maximum font-size using this formula: */
@media (min-width: 589px) {
    #demo-1 {
        /* Breakpoint âœ• ( Viewport Units / 100 ) */
        /* 589px âœ• ( 6.25vw / 100 ) = 36.8125px */
        font-size: 36.8125px;
    }
}
```

_Caveat: Iâ€™m using `px` here in a few places where Iâ€™d normally use `ems` or `rems`, to make the example code easier to read._

### Formulas

#### Transition from Fixed Minimum font-size to Viewport Units

This is used in the above example at the `320px` breakpoint.

```
Viewport Units = ( font-size (px) / Breakpoint (px) ) âœ• 100
```

#### Transition from Viewport Units to Fixed Maximum font-size

This is used in the above example at the `589px` breakpoint.

```
font-size (px) = Breakpoint (px) âœ• ( Viewport Units / 100 )
```

After you have your pixels, of course you can convert to `rem` or `em` as desired.

### Smaller Delta

If you want the text to grow or shrink at a reduced rate, you can use `calc` to sum a `vw` unit with a fixed CSS unit (like `px` or `em`)â€”but getting your boundaries aligned properly is a bit more difficult and beyond the scope of what Iâ€™d like to cover here. An exercise left up to the reader ðŸ˜‡.

_Update on 2018 May 25_: There is an incredible article written by <a href="https://fvsch.com/">Florens Verschelde</a> about <a href="https://fvsch.com/code/css-locks/">The Math of CSS Locks</a> which covers this exact subject. Seriously, go read itâ€”itâ€™s amazing.

### Twin Props

```css
#demo-1 {
    /* Minimum font-size */
    font-size: 20px;
    font-size: 6.25vw;
}
```

Iâ€™ve seen some developers suggest forgoing the minimum media query altogether with the above code. This is _probably_ fine but I donâ€™t really like that an unbounded minimum font-size could quickly become unreadable at super small breakpoints. Get on that smart watch, yâ€™all.

## Bikeshedding a New Unit

It does make me wonder how container queries (or similar) might work with Viewport Units. Iâ€™m starting to see now that the addition of a future Container Unit might be warranted to simplify the above code.

```css
#demo-2 {
    font-size: 20px;
}
@media (min-width: 320px) {
    #demo-2 {
        /* Beware: `cw` is not a real unit */
        font-size: 6.25cw;
    }
}
```

This would alleviate the need for the second breakpoint altogether, as the font-size would be determined by the size of an arbitrary container, which already has an upper bound `max-width` on it.

## Anyway

All of this build-up is really just to say that I made all my blog post titles huge and it makes me really happy. Iâ€™m using Viewport Units with a minimum boundary only ðŸ˜Ž.

If your screen is wide enough (perhapsâ€”sayâ€”a viewport size of 3440px), you can probably read them from space:

<img src="/web/img/posts/extra-readable-titles/big.png" alt="Giant Viewport Preview of the Blog Post Title">

This is likely just the beginning of a long string of changes Iâ€™ll make to the super-wide layout for my blog.

    <h3>Update</h3>
    <p>One hefty drawback to this approach (using only <code>vw</code> units to scale text) noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew__romanov/status/992482401053036544">Andrew Romanov</a> is that the text no longer zooms appropriately with page zoom! He proposes using <code>calc</code> with a combination of fixed and viewport units for at least some text zooming.
