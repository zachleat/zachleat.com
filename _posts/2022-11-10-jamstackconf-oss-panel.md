* [Jamstack Conf Agenda](https://jamstack.org/conf/agenda/panel-oss-is-out-to-end-the-framework-wars/)

> Ryan Carniato (SolidJS), Fred K. Schott (Astro), Zach Leatherman (11ty), Jessica Janiuk (Angular), Alexandre Chopin (Nuxt), Sara Vieira (Axo)
> The guiding principle of open source has always been that sharing our knowledge makes us all stronger. However, to look at the dogmatic behavior surrounding some frameworks, it’s hard to spot that principle in action these days.
> Fortunately, a new cohort of frameworks is emerging that’s fully embracing collaboration, shared credit, and cooperation. In this panel, we’ll hear from the people building these frameworks and learn how we’re getting better software by working together instead of trying to “win.”

## Post-conference Thoughts

One post-JamstackConf thought I wish I had communicated better on the frameworks panel:

The web will be better served by a broader plurality of successful frameworks: Lit, Qwik, Solid, Astro, Svelte, Marko, Eleventy, and the one y’all are dreaming up now!

The post-React world is here, it just needs your help to be evenly distributed 🏆
