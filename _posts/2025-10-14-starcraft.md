[StarCraft II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty) was first released in 2010 and it’s still amazing:

- Free-to-play (since 2017)
- It’s an old game so it works on a wide variety of hardware and software.
- Great tutorial play that trains new players from scratch (even those without any real-time-strategy experience).
- It includes a multiplayer co-op mode!

I have some old work and personal computers sitting around and was able to install Battle.net and StarCraft II on 4 different machines (some Windows, some macOS) for a little family LAN party — it was *awesome*.

Watching our 8 and 10 year old shout out cooperative instructions as we battled against the computer was special — a nod to the before-times: playing video games with friends in childhood basements.

A few caveats:

- You’ll want a mouse for this game (you can’t play this game with a trackpad). I picked up a few super-cheap Logitech mice for the kids.
- The CAPTCHA when signing up for a new Battle.net account is unbelievably terrible (I had to add up an unbelievably number of pictures of dice to make 4 accounts).
