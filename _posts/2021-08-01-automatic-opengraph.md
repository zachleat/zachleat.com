[Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) images. Those little images that show up when your site is shared on social media. The ones for my site wereâ€¦ bad. My default was to use one, huge, boring branded image for everythingâ€”which provided no extra value and just cluttered up yâ€™alls feeds (sorry!). I wanted to make them better and hereâ€™s what I did.

## The Lazy Method

While building a [screenshot cloud service](/web/screenshots/) for 11ty.dev, it became obvious that I should add an Open Graph size to use screenshots as Open Graph images. You can see this in use on the Eleventy docs pages:

* Navigate to [`https://www.11ty.dev/docs/`](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/)
* With the screenshot service in place, itâ€™s just one line for a custom Open Graph image: `<meta property="og:image" content="https://v1.screenshot.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.11ty.dev%2Fdocs%2F/opengraph/">`
* The social card image looks like this: ![Open Graph images for 11ty.dev/docs/](https://v1.screenshot.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.11ty.dev%2Fdocs%2F/opengraph/)

For the amount of work this took to setup, it was totally worth it (one `<meta>`!). But I wanted to take it to the next level for my personal blog (with a long term goal of maybe convincing my colleagues to use something like this on netlify.com ðŸ˜…).

## The Underwhelming Method

In the past, I did experiment a bit with using the [SVG to raster image feature of Eleventy Image](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-image/#svg-flies-first-class) (via [`sharp`](https://github.com/lovell/sharp)) but it wasnâ€™t quite what I wanted. It had the benefit of being much faster than HTML-based methods (usually based on [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/)) but I ended up having to slog through a bunch of hand-written SVG to get it to look how I wanted to look. Iâ€™ll admit, Iâ€™m not as productive at hand-authoring SVG as Iâ€™d like.

## The Fancy Method

With those experiences under my belt, I decided to custom design a page on my site ([source code](https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com/blob/1b396e18bbe5e8a7b050497b501b85256cc78620/web/_posts/opengraph-posts.liquid#L12)) that would iterate over each blog post and could serve as the target for my screenshot service. This provided a couple of benefits:
* I can use all of the existing HTML/CSS/JS/Fonts already in use on my site. That means fake browser chrome, custom Twitter avatars, Lighthouse scores, popularity ranks, among others!
* I donâ€™t have to run Puppeteer locally. I try to avoid this when possibleâ€”it is awesome but it slows down the build (a lot).

Each individual blog post has a dedicated Open Graph image page, for example [`/opengraph/web/automatic-opengraph/`](/opengraph/web/automatic-opengraph/) (_Fair warning: this page is not using responsive web design principles. It is specifically created for the 1200Ã—630 aspect ratio_).

If I want a custom background image for a single postâ€™s open graph image, I add front matter with the image url:

```yaml
---
seo:
  openGraphBackgroundImage: /og/sources/graphpaper.jpg
---
```

Next, in my base Eleventy layout file ([source code](https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com/blob/1b396e18bbe5e8a7b050497b501b85256cc78620/_includes/layouts/base.liquid#L21)) I point the Open Graph page for each specific blog post towards the screenshot service to capture the image:

```
{% ogImageSource page %}
```

It looks like this:

<img src="{% ogImageSource page %}" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="630" alt="Open Graph sample image">

I wanted the image to have the post title, my avatar, the published date, and the URL of the page.

For bonus metadata, hereâ€™s one with a Lighthouse score attached ([updated regularly via Speedlify](https://www.speedlify.dev/zachleat.com/)), a webmentions count, and even the page weight (e.g. 226 KiB, also driven by Speedlify):

<img src="https://v1.screenshot.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zachleat.com%2Fopengraph%2Fweb%2Fcomprehensive-webfonts%2F/opengraph/" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="630" alt="Open Graph sample image with Lighthouse score">

## Bonus Features

### DevTools Device Emulation

Inside of Chrome Devtools, I added a custom Emulated Device specifically for Open Graph image formats to test the layouts.

### Social Card Preview

I added a little `<details>` on the bottom of each blog post so that I could test the [social card image preview](#opengraph-preview). Iâ€™ll probably pivot this to a link-based sharing widget at some point or combine into my existing [Retweet to Share component](/web/style-guide/#retweet-to-share).

### On-demand Builder Cache Busting

The [Eleventy Screenshot service](/web/screenshots/) is an independent project that uses On-demand Builders to cache screenshot image content to Netlifyâ€™s CDN. That cache is pretty sticky. The easiest way to invalidate the cache is to trigger a Screenshot service build on Netlify, but that would reset the cache for _all_ screenshots saved by the service, which is too heavy. It has been a common request for a more granular Netlify API to reset pieces of the cache but during the development of this project I realized that we can handle this manually on the app side using our old friend, [the Cache Buster URL](https://github.com/11ty/api-screenshot/#advanced-manual-cache-busting).

If the old URL looked like this `https://v1.screenshot.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zachleat.com%2Fopengraph%2Fweb%2Fcomprehensive-webfonts%2F/opengraph/`, I can add an arbitrary cache busting key to the end of it (prefixed by an underscore to identify it anywhere in the URL).

If I generated that key with todayâ€™s date (e.g. `https://v1.screenshot.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zachleat.com%2Fopengraph%2Fweb%2Fcomprehensive-webfonts%2F/opengraph/_20210803/`), it would generate new images every day without the screenshot service needing to invalidate the entire cache.
