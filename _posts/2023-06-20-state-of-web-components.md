I was honored to speak alongside Justin Fagnani (Lit), Kristofer Joseph (Begin, Enhance.dev), and Rob Eisenberg about the current state of the Web Components ecosystem.

We talked a bit about the controversial `is` attribute, how we’re all excited about upcoming Declarative Custom Element definitions, the long term benefits of staying close to the platform, but somehow didn’t touch on adding JSX to the platform (disappointing I know).

Watch the livestream below:
