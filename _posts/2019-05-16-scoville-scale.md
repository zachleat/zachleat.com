_Originally presented at Beyond Tellerrand in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª in May, 2019._

This talk was a grab bag of personal font loading opinions that Iâ€™ve been collecting over quite some time to package up for a talk. [David Carson](http://www.davidcarsondesign.com/) said that it was a great talk but the kerning on a few of my slides was off ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜±ðŸ˜‡. I was so pleased that he took the time to attendâ€”he was around for most of the conference!

This conference really was something special. [Marc Thiele](https://twitter.com/marcthiele) is an amazing conference organizer. His attention to detail and willingness to promote other things happening in the community is incredible. If you get the chance to attend one of Marcâ€™s conferences, **do it**.
