**Updated: There is a [newer version of this presentation available](/web/rwd-perf-3/).**

The presentation was originally given to [NebraskaJS](http://nebraskajs.com/2012/performance-in-rwd/) in November of 2012. Unfortunately due to my own technical ineptitude with screen recording software I wasn’t able to publish the talk. So when I was asked to present on the topic again at the [Omaha Mobile Group](http://www.meetup.com/Omaha-Mobile-Group/events/104130942/), I thought it would be a good opportunity to update the talk and get a second chance at recording it in front of an audience.
