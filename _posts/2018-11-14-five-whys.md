_Originally presented at [Performance.now(), The Web Performance Conference](https://perfnow.nl/) on November 8th, 2018 in Amsterdam, Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±._

This was a completely revamped version of my Web Font Loading talk with a brand new theme and new examples. I took the audience through a case study improving the web font loading of the default theme you get when you create a new blog on wordpress.com. It originally loaded five different font files from Google Fonts.

The presentation iterated through a variety of different font loading tools and showed how they affected the performance of the site using real data and results from [webpagetest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org/).

* Demos on [Netlify at `performance-sometime.netlify.com`](https://performance-sometime.netlify.com/).
* Source code on [GitHub at `zachleat/performance-sometime`](https://github.com/zachleat/performance-sometime).

Some of the tests and approaches demoed here are _not yet documented_ on [A Comprehensive Guide to Font Loading Strategies](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/) nor are they available on [`web-font-loading-recipes`](https://github.com/zachleat/web-font-loading-recipes) (but soon).
