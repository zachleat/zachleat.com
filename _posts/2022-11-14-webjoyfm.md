A tweet with video teaser from [`@WebJoyFM`](https://twitter.com/WebJoyFM/status/1592179007097024512): _“Season 1, Episode 21: ‘Everyone has a very important voice’ with @Zachleat came out the other week. Want a preview? We discuss how to get started putting your thoughts on your own website (oddly timely, despite this being recorded well before the recent Twitter drama).”_
