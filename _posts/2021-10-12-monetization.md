Three years into working on Eleventy, I continue to be blown away by [the adoption and community support](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/jamstack-survey-2021/) of folks contributing to the underdog.

It has me thinking about sustainability models for this style of web frameworkâ€”[what are other folks doing to fund development](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1447940347384971275)? Recent news would suggest that more and more folks are going the route of taking investment. It has me considering the hidden costs of such routes.

Nonetheless, I thought the best place to start would be to compile the data.

_This list was loosely compiled from the [Jamstack Community Survey 2021](https://jamstack.org/survey/2021/#choices-frameworks)._

## Ownership

Ownership is such an interesting piece of the game here. Is it better to have a framework owned by a company? And better for whom? Iâ€™m sure they have increased velocity, delivering and <em>moving fast</em> with dedicated resources. But what happens when the corporate interests diverge from the communityâ€™s interests? One is reminded of [Basecampâ€™s implosion](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418208/basecamp-all-hands-meeting-employee-resignations-buyouts-implosion) and [the downstream effects it had on their open source projects](https://twitter.com/sstephenson/status/1388146131377528832). Similarlyâ€”in a hypothetical world where folks on the React core team resigned from Facebook, it would have devastating effects on the React community and the future of React.

Alternatively, I decided early that I wanted Eleventy to be independent from commercial ownership and had very positive and supportive discussions about that when I joined Netlify. From the outside it would appear that both Svelte and Preact and has taken a similar route but Iâ€™d love to learn more about how those are set up.

It should be said that decoupled ownership is risky in a different way to folks deciding whether to trust a frameworkâ€”will it have the resources to support regular maintenance? Will it have the legs to continue to be viable in 5 years?

My opinions here are probably obvious now: I think commercial ownership and tight coupling has more downsides than independence. It reminds me of employer-provided healthcare in the United Statesâ€”having it tightly coupled is far less flexible and makes it harder to switch employers (to the benefit of the employer).

## Larger Trends

After compiling the data, there are a couple of clear trends at play here:

1. Ownership by a company (unrelated to the framework). e.g. Facebook, eBay, Google.
2. Raise investment, form a hosting company for the framework. Meteor was one of the first examples I found to take this approach. But both Gatsby and Next.js have popularized this. I donâ€™t feel comfortable with this, either. The way to make money becomes hosting vendor lock-in at the framework level ðŸ˜±
3. Take donations. I think Vue is doing the best job of this. The other thing Vue does well is:
4. Sell sponsorships. Though, a word of caution as some [less-than-reputable sponsors have figured out that sponsorship is a cheap way to buy backlinks](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1295370536600707078), which some very popular projects have decided is a necessary evil to monetization (I donâ€™t agree). <!--Babel, Jest, Bower, and Socket.io -->
5. Sell subscriptions. Remix went this way originally. They had some success but low adoption and changed it up when they raised investment.

1 and 2 are almost exclusively distinct. 3 does not pair well with 1 or 2. 3 and 4 can pair nicely.

## Conclusion

I donâ€™t have the answers. I definitely wouldnâ€™t agree that Eleventy has figured out our sustainable monetization strategy but I do really admire the success that Vue has had solving this exact problem. I do know that I have no interest in Trend 2 but Iâ€™ll continue to keep a keen eye on what other indie-framework folks are doing.
