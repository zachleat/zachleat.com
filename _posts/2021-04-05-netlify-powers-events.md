Netlify power-hitters [{% imgavatar "AshlynnPolini", "z-avatar-eq" %}Ashlynn Polini](https://twitter.com/AshlynnPolini), [{% imgavatar "huguestennier", "z-avatar-eq" %}Hugues Tennier](https://twitter.com/huguestennier) (and me too, I guess) participated in a panel at [Sanity’s Content is Data Open House](https://www.sanity.io/content-is-data-open-house-2021). We demoed how we used Sanity to empower Netlify’s marketing team to create new Events.

It also includes the world premiere of the [Eleventy Cloud Demo repository](https://github.com/11ty/demo-eleventy-cloud/), a small repository to show how to run Eleventy in a Netlify serverless function. (Also see [this tweet about Eleventy Cloud](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1365091172138569730))
