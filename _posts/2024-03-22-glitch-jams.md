I was honored to be the very first guest to Glitch Jams Live! Glitch has always been a huge supporter of Eleventy‚Äîwith a very prominent button to create an Eleventy Starter project on their home page.

With the recent migration of the [Glitch Blog](https://blog.glitch.com/) _(via [Keith Kurson on Mastodon](https://cute.is/@keith/112131478352732498))_ to use Eleventy v3.0 and WebC, it was the perfect time to join the stream to chat. We walked through a bunch of my favorite Built With Eleventy personal and community sites too.

> This week we're welcoming our first ever guest to the stream - Zach Leatherman, a pal who happened to create and maintains our favorite site generator, Eleventy. Join Jenn Schiffer as she shares all the cool apps the community shared over the last week on Glitch, and then learn about Eleventy and how we've moved the Glitch blog over to it this month! üçì
