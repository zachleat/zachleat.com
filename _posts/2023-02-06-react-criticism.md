title: "A Historical Reference of React Criticism"
---
There have been a number of criticisms levied at the React project over the years, some of them handled and some of them still wavering in the wind. In this post, I‚Äôll summarize the ones that are most prominent in my memory as a way of maintaining a record (primarily for my own use but maybe you‚Äôll find it useful too). If you have others, [please send them my way](https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat)!

[Researching the Performance costs of JavaScript MVC Frameworks‚ÄîJohn Bender](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/mv-initial-load-times/) _(December 12, 2014)_

To my knowledge this was the first data-backed criticism of the SPA/clientside rendering model. It showed an average React performance baseline of 1.26 seconds to first render on a mobile device over 3G, when performance guidelines recommended a goal of first render in under one second.

The React popularization of client-side rendering did not exist in a vacuum. It was happening _as_ developers struggled to make this model of client-side React work on an increasingly diverse and demanding world-wide mobile device landscape, especially as [Responsive Web Design won](https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1262795599390420994) over m-dot architectures for most web work.

<div class="livedemo" data-demo-label="Side Note">

_I‚Äôm reminded of Mark Zuckerberg famously [admitting that Facebook bet _too much_ on HTML5 for mobile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBp_xCGIATk), although I haven‚Äôt seen a connection between that 2012 quote and React‚Äôs initial release in 2013._

</div>

In the post, John states:

> There are practical approaches we can already use today to reliably produce very fast rendering times, but they work best when HTML content is delivered from the server side rather than generating it solely on the client. That approach benefits many areas of user experience aside from performance alone‚Ä¶

The above quote seems incredibly prescient in hindsight and still (somehow) relevant to modern day React discourse as they finally _begin_ to pivot away from `create-react-app`.

But notably, **{{ "12 Dec 2014" | timePosted }}** after the blog post was written, that pivot is as of now only an [idea](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741). Currently the React documentation still recommends clientside rendering:

> [‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre learning React or creating a new single-page app, use Create React App.‚Äù](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#recommended-toolchains)

It hasn‚Äôt improved with the new beta React Docs either:

> [‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre learning React, we recommend Create React App. It is the most popular way to try out React and build a new single-page, client-side application‚Äù](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/start-a-new-react-project)

<div class="livedemo" data-demo-label="Side Note">

_It **is** interesting that they have anointed Next.js as the official chosen full-featured framework moving forward in the Beta documentation. I‚Äôm sure it has nothing to do with [Next.js 13 being](https://twitter.com/RyanCarniato/status/1584973099740499968) the [‚Äúreal React 18 release‚Äù](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1549853625673023488)._

> React has significant costs, especially on mobile. React has a lot of computational work required to do all of its checks. On mobile the cost is far higher than I think is reasonable.

Alright, so you‚Äôre _not_ a beginner or you‚Äôre not building an app. You know better than to fall into the Create React App pit of client-side rendering performance problems and use a React framework that uses **server side** rendering, right? Well, _not so fast_.

[üåü When everything's important, nothing is! üåü‚ÄîPaul Lewis](https://aerotwist.com/blog/when-everything-is-important-nothing-is/) _(December 10, 2016)_

This post was a very early criticism of how Server Side Rendered frameworks using Virtual DOM still block the main thread in a pretty bad way:

> SSR typically gets you a faster First Meaningful Paint. That's great for perceived performance, but for libraries / frameworks that recreate the DOM virtually, TTI seems to be pushed back, sometimes a long way. I guess the diffing of real DOM to make VDOM is more expensive than starting fresh?

The Progressive Booting section (to me) reads as the precursor to [Islands architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) _(August 11, 2020)_, with a special call in both this and the Islands architecture post to make more use of `requestIdleCallback` in frameworks, which as far as I could tell is [not included with React 18](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/21662#issuecomment-859671432) (with or without Suspense).

React‚Äôs open source license (with a patent clause) was [classified by the Apache Software Foundation as a Category-X (read: problematic) license](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303?focusedCommentId=16088736&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16088736), meaning that it could not be used for Apache.org projects _(July 15, 2017)_.

The React team at Facebook [posted an explanation doubling down on a licensing choice](https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/) _(August 18, 2017)_ that had been in use since the project‚Äôs initial release in 2013.

One month after Facebook‚Äôs post, Matt Mullenweg (of WordPress) writes [a blog post stating that WordPress would divest from React](https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/) _(September 14, 2017)_ in large in-progress projects Calpyso and Gutenberg.

Facebook [reversed the decision](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/09/22/web/relicensing-react-jest-flow-and-immutable-js/) _(September 22, 2017)_ for React v16 a few days later.

The patent clause remained in place for many other open source projects at Facebook (and all prior versions of React).

Currently, React 18.2.0 passes 0/14 of the advanced tests on the [Custom Elements Everywhere tests](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/). An experimental build of React is available but it is not (and at this point may never ship?) in a stable release.

> ‚Äú√∏JS is coming to Next üîú‚Äù‚Äî[Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1437494013137805312)

I remember this tweet pretty vividly, even now! What an exciting possibility‚Äîand ‚Äúsoon‚Äù!

The tweet was posted on September 13, 2021, a full year before [Next.js v13 shipped on October 25, 2022](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13). Astute readers might note that Next.js v13 did not ship with √∏JS. The Next.js v13 bundle size was **44 kB larger** than v12‚Äîabout **half of one React library larger**, in fact.

<div class="livedemo" data-demo-label="Side Note">

_As an aside, I‚Äôm curious how much of this had to do with miscommunicated expectations around React Server Components, given the criticisms [also levied by the Hydrogen team at Shopify](https://twitter.com/FredKSchott/status/1587095801917865984)._

_**Update February 6, 2023**: previously this section incorrectly [stated the Remix team as the origin behind issues with server components](https://mas.to/@frehner/109819967948651263)._

Notably, 2021 Guillermo Rauch is a welcome pivot from 2013 Guillermo Rauch, confidently [stating that ‚ÄúSingle-page, JavaScript-driven apps are the future‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar9R-CX217o&t=232s). Though [2023 Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1619492334961569792) seems to have jumped the shark üòÖ.

We might also remember that these frameworks are recommended by the React team on the official documentation for _content sites_ and that [Next.js, Gatsby, and Remix have long used the _blog site_ as the quintessential starter project in their respective Getting Started documentation](/web/build-benchmark/).

Here are a few baseline bundle sizes:

* Next.js (v13) was [90 kB (compressed), 272 kB (uncompressed)](https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1584995586918731776/) (as of 25 Oct 2022)
* Remix (v1.5.1) was [67.7 kB (compressed)](https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1534588439580090368/) (as of 8 Jun 2022)
* Next.js (v12) was [72.2 kB (compressed), 228 kB (uncompressed)](https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1468419834501337088) (as of 7 Dec 2021)

An analysis of Core Web Vitals across 9.3 million web sites as of February 6, 2023 shows that Core Web Vitals for both [React and Next.js shows that both perform **worse**](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/lD9m_MQgyGU) **than the aggregation of all other sites** in the archive for _both_ mobile and desktop.

Currently only _26% of sites using Next.js have good Core Web Vitals_. This is lower than React at-large (32.81%) and the entirety of all sites in the data set (39.37%).
