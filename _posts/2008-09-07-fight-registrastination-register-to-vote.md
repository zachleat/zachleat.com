For those demanding technical content from each blog post, the page does use a nice [JavaScript IP Address Geocoder hosted by MaxMind][2] that’s worth a look. It also uses a previously mentioned [JavaScript Pretty Date Difference][3] script.

Here’s a few other things that one might also look at if they were making a location aware application:

*   [Google Maps API: Geocoding][4]
*   [Gears GeoLocation API][5]
*   [Parse a Facebook user’s location.][6]
*   Twitter’s API only provides update_location, not a way to get the current location.
*   As mentioned above, [MaxMind’s IP Address Geocoding Service][8]
*   [Yahoo’s FireEagle][9], [BrightKite][10], [Plazes][11], and [Dopplr][12]

MaxMind’s seemed the best fit for my use case: guessing the State of an anonymous user.
