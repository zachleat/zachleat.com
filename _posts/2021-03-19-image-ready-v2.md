This is a meetup talk given at [Jamstack TORONTO](/web/jamstack-toronto/2021/) about [Eleventy Image](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/). It was really fun to give a talk alongside the folks from Gatsby.js, Next.js, and Sanity folks to see how they handle images. I’m really proud of the featureset that Eleventy Image has and how it compares to the others.

This talk was also converted to blog post format at: **[Don’t Shut Down Your Business! Instead, use Eleventy Image.](/web/eleventy-image/)**
