I was on the JS Party podcast to talk about the [push to make 11ty independent and sustainability in 2024](/web/independent-sustainable-11ty/)!

> 11ty creator Zach Leatherman is taking the open source site generator fully independent in 2024 and he’s back on the pod to tell us why, how & what we all can do to help.

I’ve been blown away by the response so far, y’all are amazing. At time of this post we’re currently at 56% of the goal.
