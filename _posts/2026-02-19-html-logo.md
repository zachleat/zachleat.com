\*_Not official._

I was working on my slide deck for the [upcoming State of the Browser conference](https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/) and ran into what I would classify the recurring issue of the lack of an official logo for (version-free) HTML. There is a logo for HTML 5, but that versioned marketing term has long fallen out of regular use (introduced 18 years ago).

This is a community solved problem in both the CSS and JavaScript spaces!

- CSS: {% icon "fab:css" %}, [relevant discussion on `CSS-Next`](https://github.com/CSS-Next/css-next/issues/105).
- JS: {% icon "fab:js" %}, [relevant discussion on `voodootikigod/logo.js`](https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js).
- HTML 5: {% icon "fab:html5" %}, [more info on w3.org](https://www.w3.org/html/logo/).

I wish the classic orange badge hadn’t included a version number, but alas.

Anyway, I very quickly [threw my hat into the ring](https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/116093900452223373
)) and immediately recognized a [much better option from Sam Stephenson](https://indieweb.social/@sstephenson/116098428280403793) (personal home page: [`sls.name`](https://sls.name/)) that I’ll be considering canon moving forward (and hopefully this blog post puts some weight behind it for others too).

Here’s what it might look like, rendered in your web browser:

<div class="flex flex-center"><a href="https://indieweb.social/@sstephenson/116098428280403793" style="all:initial;cursor:pointer;font-size:2em;width:5em;height:5em;color:blue;text-decoration:underline;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;background:#ccc;border:.5em outset #aaa;font-weight:900;">HTML</a></div>

I love the nod to the classic unvisited link color and the heavy outset border that doubles as angle brackets with the right head tilt.

If you’re interested in the source code, I’ll include the HTML-only (copy-paste friendly) source code below [_(also on Codepen)_](https://codepen.io/zachleat/pen/azZggqZ):

```html

```
