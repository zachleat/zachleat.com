\*_Not official._

I was working on my slide deck for the [upcoming State of the Browser conference](https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/) and ran into what I would classify as a recurring issue: HTML needs a logo. There isn’t a broadly accepted official logo for (version-independent) HTML. There _is_ a logo for HTML 5, but that versioned marketing term has long fallen out of regular use (and was introduced 18 years ago).

This is a community solved problem in both the CSS and JavaScript spaces!

- CSS: {% icon "fab:css" %}, [relevant discussion on `CSS-Next`](https://github.com/CSS-Next/css-next/issues/105).
- JS: {% icon "fab:js" %}, [relevant discussion on `voodootikigod/logo.js`](https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js).
- HTML 5: {% icon "fab:html5" %}, [more info on w3.org](https://www.w3.org/html/logo/).

I wish the classic orange badge hadn’t included a version number, but alas.

Anyway, I very quickly [threw my hat into the ring](https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/116093900452223373
) and immediately recognized a [much better option from Sam Stephenson](https://indieweb.social/@sstephenson/116098428280403793) [{% icon "fas:user" %}`sls.name`](https://sls.name/) that I’ll be considering canon moving forward (and hopefully this blog post puts some weight behind it for others too).

Here’s what it looks like rendered in your web browser:

<div class="flex flex-center"><a href="https://indieweb.social/@sstephenson/116098428280403793" style="all:initial;cursor:pointer;font-size:2em;width:5em;height:5em;color:blue;text-decoration:underline;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;background:#ccc;border:.5em outset #aaa;font-weight:900;">HTML</a></div>

I love the nod to the classic unvisited link color and the heavy outset border that doubles as angle brackets with the right head tilt.

If you’re interested in the source code, the HTML-only (copy-paste friendly) source code is included below [_(and also on Codepen)_](https://codepen.io/zachleat/pen/azZggqZ):
